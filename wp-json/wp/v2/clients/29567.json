Use cases of such tokens are limitless \u2013 they can be used as virtual IDs, certificates, verification keys, or even double as governance tokens to conduct elections.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WHAT WAS THE TASK?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The software development task was focused on the development of the initial soulbound token MVP that will be later used in the closed beta for the Soul Search project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the initial MVP, Blaize was requested to develop a solution that would include SBT tokens minted as a sign of the partnership between two companies. Therefore, SBT will be presented as a non-transferrable NFT (ERC1155). The project also contained additional functionality for simple metadata storage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PROJECT ARCHITECTURE<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Soul Search only needed a proof of concept, so it wasn\u2019t supposed to be automated from the start. The team planned to use the automated architecture to show how it would be automated in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full scope of the project: Registry, mint Controller, and SBT smart contracts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1304\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Soul-Search.svg\" alt=\"SoulSearch project architecture\" class=\"wp-image-70921\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">SoulSearch project architecture<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong><em>ADVANCING YOUR BLOCKCHAIN ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY WITH <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/smart-contracts\/\"><strong><em>SMART CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The core team for the MVP development consisted of:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A blockchain technology lead responsible for the delivery of the project artifacts, coordination of the development team, preparation of the technical solution, its implementation review, and acceptance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Two blockchain Solidity engineers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Blaize also provided a supervising team:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A Project Manager who was responsible for communication with the Customer, coordination of the project development team, and coordination of the delivery.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A blockchain solutions architect responsible for the review and approval of major technical solutions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The development sprint included smart contract development for the initial MVP phase, which consisted of SBT contract (for the partnership), mint Controller contract and Registry (for data aggregation), and unit test coverage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CHALLENGES WE CONFRONTED<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some difficulties associated with helping to choose a type of license for the project and preparing a brief comparison of open-source licenses as the client wasn\u2019t sure which one to choose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, since the SBT and MetadataRegistry smart contracts are not upgradeable, we needed to think through all the features that could be implemented in the future (such as the ability for users to burn their tokens). This had to be done in the most secure and flexible way possible since any future requirements were unknown at that moment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>RESULT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of this development sprint, we have created a smart-contract MVP \u2013 working contracts deployed on the Polygon testnet that include the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Soulbound ERC1155 contract, non-transferrable, reflecting the partnership between two companies;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smart contract for storing the metadata of SBTs;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Smart contract for safe minting of new SBTs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The developed MVP allows the Soul Search project to function on the basic level of the underlying smart contracts. We look forward to collaborating with the team in the future to keep working on the full product functionality.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":29569,"template":"","clientcat":[487,362,485],"clientstage":[346],"clientblockchain":[464],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.9.1 -
