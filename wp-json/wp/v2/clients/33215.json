By setting a specific price point, traders can automate their trading strategy and effectively manage risk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For OMOMO, we successfully implemented a limit orders system with zero swap fees, leveraging the concentrated liquidity feature of ref.finance. This addition to the platform provides users with increased control and flexibility when executing their trades, further enhancing their overall trading experience on the OMOMO platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was done as part of <a href=\"https:\/\/nearcon-irl-hackathon.devpost.com\/\">NEAR IRL Hackathon<\/a> and won Ref.finance <a href=\"https:\/\/nearcon-irl-hackathon.devpost.com\/submissions\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;prize_filter%5Bprizes%5D%5B%5D=59205\">bounty<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PROJECT ARCHITECTURE<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The charts below demonstrate the part of business logic of the limit orders mechanics we implemented for OMOMO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1312\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33216\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-6.png 1600w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-6-1536x1260.png 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-6-1568x1286.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-7.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33217\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-7.png 1600w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-7-1536x1280.png 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/image-7-1568x1306.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background wp-block-heading\"><strong>TRADING IS A CRUCIAL DIRECTION FOR BLOCKCHAIN PROJECTS. DISCOVER <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/developer-tools\/\"><strong>MORE<\/strong><\/a><strong> ABOUT OUR DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS.<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hackathons are always thrilling for a developer, but for us, it was twice more exciting and stressful because we had to win a hackathon and create an MVP product in one run.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we simultaneously working on this project within hackathon limited in time, so the whole team of architect, blockchain, backend, and frontend engineers was working more than 18 hours during those days trying to keep a balance between features, stability, and architecture. There were no processes except the communicate-plan-do-test loop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CHALLENGES WE CONFRONTED<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Except for short hackathon deadlines, we also had to investigate and integrate our smart contracts with black-box API of ref.finance smart-contracts (at that point, there was no ref.finance SDK which brings little bit more light on how everything works under the hood). In order to tackle this challenge, we had to make all calculations manually and then implement a specific model to reproduce the mathematics of ref finance API. The black-box nature of the API meant that we had to trust our understanding of the inner workings of the protocol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these challenges, our team was able to successfully develop and implement the limit order system by thoroughly understanding the core concepts and ensuring that our model was accurate. In conclusion, we were able to provide a stable and effective solution that works seamlessly with the ref finance protocol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>RESULT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We managed to achieve all our client\u2019s aims and built an MVP for limit orders with zero swap fee based on ref.finance concentrated liquidity and won the hackathon ref.finance bounty. The code we wrote during the hackathon became a part of OMOMO leverage trading product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within our cooperation with OMOMO, the following achievements were made during the project:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Successfully implemented limit orders with zero swap fees<\/li><li>Integrated with ref.finance&#8217;s concentrated liquidity feature<\/li><li>Provided users with increased control and flexibility in their trading strategies<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, our team&#8217;s dedication and expertise led to the successful development and implementation of a limit order system with zero swap fees for OMOMO. This accomplishment not only enhanced the trading experience for OMOMO users but also demonstrated our ability to tackle complex challenges in the blockchain and DeFi space.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":33218,"template":"","clientcat":[365,356,362],"clientstage":[368],"clientblockchain":[473],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.9.1 -
