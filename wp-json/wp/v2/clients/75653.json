Blaize collaborated with OMOMO across three major milestones to build, enhance, and optimize the protocol: <strong>Money Market Protocol Development<\/strong>, <strong>Limit Orders Implementation<\/strong>, and <strong>Leverage Trading Development and Implementation<\/strong>. This unified effort has transformed OMOMO into a leading DeFi hub within the NEAR ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collaboration began with Blaize expanding its Rust expertise to delve into the NEAR ecosystem. Inspired by the community at NEARcon 2021, we introduced a concept for a lending\/borrowing protocol during the Nearhack Hackathon in Kyiv, which won a grant prize. Over the following months, we formalized the protocol\u2019s architecture, conducted smart contract audits, and developed a brand identity for OMOMO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MILESTONE 1: MONEY MARKET PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WHAT WAS THE TASK?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main task for this milestone was to design and develop a permissionless borrow\/lending protocol where all transactions are executed entirely on-chain and managed by smart contracts. The protocol needed to provide users with the ability to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Supply and borrow assets in a decentralized manner.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Retain ownership of leveraged positions through secure and transparent borrowing mechanisms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eliminate DEX fees and slippage for all asset swaps.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enable DAO-governed management of asset tiers and protocol parameters to ensure decentralization and adaptability<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PROJECT ARCHITECTURE<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The architecture for the Money Market Protocol was designed to prioritize modularity, scalability, and security. The core components included:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Market Contracts:<\/strong> Dedicated contracts to handle specific asset classes. These contracts manage user deposits, borrow requests, and interest calculations for both lenders and borrowers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Controller Contract:<\/strong> A centralized module governed by a DAO that facilitates interactions across Market Contracts. It also handles protocol configurations, user flows, and maintains an overarching governance layer for seamless cross-market operations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Contracts.svg\" alt=\"\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The architecture of the lending\/borrowing part<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This foundational architecture was further enhanced with built-in compatibility for future trading features, such as leveraged trading and limit orders, ensuring the protocol\u2019s long-term adaptability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development process was comprehensive and iterative, focusing on ensuring both functionality and security at every stage.
