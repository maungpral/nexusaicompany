This service aims to make asset transfers and swaps secure and user-friendly, catering to the needs of both seasoned blockchain users and novices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WHAT WAS THE TASK?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary objective was to create a Telegram bot that allows users to manage their digital assets \u2014 transferring and swapping \u2014 on the Aptos blockchain. The goal was to provide a seamless interface that integrates sophisticated blockchain functionalities into a simple, accessible user experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-ebb5affb4c17c6c7cb0fda30b8dcc80b\">Blaize has a deep expertise in enhancing business with blockchain technologies.

The backend, developed using Nest.js, handles business logic and integration with blockchain functions, while the user interface is facilitated through a Telegram bot, developed with the Telegram SDK for simplicity and accessibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating advanced security features, the system uses Aptos&#8217; Identity Connect for secure, keyless account management, enhancing user privacy and security. It integrates seamlessly with external services like Aptos RPC for blockchain interactions and <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.kanalabs.io\/\">Kana Labs SDK<\/a> for swap and cross-chain functionalities, all hosted on AWS Cloud using ECS and RDS services to ensure reliability and high availability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"612\" height=\"746\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/2-7.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-61934\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The picture below reveals part of the code we crafted for Kana Labs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-ee8348f4ea56a3352ec704cbe85e9c6d\"><strong><em>BOOK <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"\/#contacts\"><strong><em>A FREE CALL<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em> WITH BLAIZE TO DISCOVER WEB3 SOLUTIONS FOR YOUR BUSINESS<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was completed over a one-month period and involved several key phases:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Initial planning and design by a team comprising a Project Manager, Solution Architect, Backend Engineer, Rust Engineer specializing in Aptos, and a DevOps Engineer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Development of the bot using the outlined tech stack, with a particular focus on integrating the Aptos and Kana Labs SDKs for blockchain interactions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rigorous testing to ensure the bot&#8217;s functionality met the security and usability standards required for handling digital assets.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Our dedicated team for this project included:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Project Manager<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solution Architect<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Backend Engineer<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rust Engineer (Aptos)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>DevOps Engineer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CHALLENGES WE CONFRONTED<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major challenges was the integration with Aptos&#8217; keyless accounts and the Identity Connect wallet provider, which are innovative yet complex aspects of wallet management on the blockchain. The team had to delve deeply into the nuances of Aptos&#8217; signature and key management processes. Additionally, the integration of the Kana Labs SDK posed a challenge due to its role in facilitating both same-chain and cross-chain swaps across various blockchain networks, requiring robust testing and secure implementation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>RESULT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our project has successfully delivered a comprehensive Telegram service that simplifies asset management on the Aptos blockchain, making it accessible even to users with limited blockchain expertise. This all-in-one tool enables efficient management of wallets and assets, allowing users to perform transfers and swaps directly within the Aptos chain. The core of this functionality is driven by the Kana Labs SDK and API, which have been integrated to facilitate an intuitive solution for on-chain swaps, handling many of the essential integrations seamlessly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through this project, we have not only enhanced user experience but also strengthened the underlying technology, making blockchain interactions more accessible and secure for everyone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":61937,"template":"","clientcat":[365,356],"clientstage":[368],"clientblockchain":[542],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.9.1 -
