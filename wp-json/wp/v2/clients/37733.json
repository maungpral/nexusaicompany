This task included developing crucial elements of blockchain architecture and product design elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHAT WAS THE TASK?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary task for the Discovery stage was to prepare the environment for the development of the decentralized part of the Radiologex platform. Radiologex simplifies communication between patients and healthcare services through their mobile application, R-Dee Go, and a unique authentication system, R-Dee Connect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enhance the security of this platform, Blaize was required to develop a blockchain layer that would ensure a secure exchange of medical files and data through decentralized technologies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Blaize has broad expertise in developing web3 solutions for various businesses. Learn more about this topic in our latest <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/services\/blockchain-integration\/why-web3-is-what-enterprise-and-business-really-need\/\">article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PROJECT ARCHITECTURE<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our vision for the project involved creating several layers for the decentralized part of the platform. These included an audit trail API, a storage layer for intermediate data and backups, a private blockchain for storing data proofs, a smart contract layer for data verification, a proofs generator for preparing Merkle proofs, and an IPFS connector for encrypted data transport. The heart of the decentralized layer was the instance of Quorum &#8211; a private EVM-chain, the most suitable for enterprise projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"910\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Planned-decentralized-components-architecture.svg\" alt=\"Planned decentralized components architecture\" class=\"wp-image-71015\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong><em>BOOK A FREE CALL WITH BLAIZE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN-BASED <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/for-enterprises\/\"><strong><em>ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em> FOR YOUR BUSINESS<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Discovery process was divided into two main streams: Product Design and Architecture Development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Product Design, our Business Analyst collected and organized requirements, clarified the business case for the decentralized part, and conducted interviews to understand user flows, resulting in an SRS for development commencement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Architecture Development, our Blockchain Architect, Tech Lead, and Backend Engineer formalized the requirements for the blockchain layer, developed the architecture for the storage layer, formalized interactions between the layers, and prepared a development roadmap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our core team consisted of a Technology Lead, a Blockchain Engineer, a Backend Engineer, and a Business Analyst, supervised by a Project Manager and a Blockchain Solutions Architect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CHALLENGES WE CONFRONTED<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main challenge we faced was the planning of integrations. Radiologex, being a complex enterprise-grade system, had multiple web2 components and its own APIs, requiring us to plan the integration with maximum utilization of the existing architectural features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RESULT<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The completion of the Discovery and Product Design phase led to the delivery of various artifacts. These included formalized requirements for the private EVM blockchain and its components, a storage layer components scheme and description, storage layer architecture, on-chain data scheme, smart contract architecture, storage access APIs architecture and specification, and a detailed development roadmap and timeline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, we were able to create a secure and effective environment for the Radiologex platform to safely store and exchange medical data using blockchain technology, aligning with our mission of using innovative solutions to enhance business operations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":37735,"template":"","clientcat":[494,383,505],"clientstage":[504],"clientblockchain":[503],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.9.1 -
