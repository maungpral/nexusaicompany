Our goal was to be a part of shaping the future by contributing to an exciting project called Urbipedia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Urbit is a new OS and peer-to-peer network that\u2019s simple by design, built to last forever, and 100% owned by its users. Under the hood, Urbit is a clean-slate software stack compact enough that an individual developer can understand and control it completely. It is a system designed for simplicity, longevity, and complete user ownership. Beneath its surface lies a software stack that empowers individual developers with control and understanding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHAT WAS THE TASK?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our mission for the hackathon was to provide the Urbipedia application-component within the Urbit environment that would implement the Zettelkasten method of information storage. Zettelkasten &#8211; small items of information stored like note that may be linked to each other through subject headings or other metadata such as numbers and tags. It has often been used as a system of note-taking and personal knowledge management for research, study, and writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This component would feature a user-friendly interface resembling a text editor, enabling users to create, view, and filter records, as well as visualize their connections in a graph.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Blaize constantly contributes to web3 industry development. Last time we partnered with IdeaSoft to create comprehensible beginner and advanced courses for development on Solana using Rust. For more details read our <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/clients\/empowering-developers-with-new-expertise-blockchain-education-courses-by-blaize-and-ideasoft\/\">blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TECH OVERVIEW<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The backbone of our project resided on the Urbit side. We strived to ensure that the storage and management of records closely mirrored the principles of the Zettelkasten method, creating a seamless user experience.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"626\" height=\"537\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/urbitpedia.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-71018\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong><em>BOOK A FREE CALL WITH BLAIZE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN-BASED <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/for-enterprises\/\"><strong><em>ENTERPRISE SOLUTIONS<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong><em> FOR YOUR BUSINESS<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A team of professionals representing Blaize at the hackathon included:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Oleg Natsibulin: Blockchain Engineer&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Svyatoslav Delyukin: Developer<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tetyana Prokopchuk: Project Manager<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Oleksiy Korobeynikov: Product Owner<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Darya Redko: UI\\UX Designer<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Oleksandr Melnyk: Front-end Developer<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The complete development process comprised several essential stages:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Definition of Basic Requirements<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We meticulously outlined the fundamental requirements for the project, setting the stage for our development process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Product Conceptualization<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>After extensive deliberation, we solidified our vision for the product, defining its core functionalities and content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Product Development<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>With a clear roadmap in place, we commenced the development process, bringing our concept to life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Finalization and Promotion<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We fine-tuned the product and created a compelling promotional video to showcase its capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Hackathon Presentation<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The culmination of our efforts was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XFypjsq_CkE\">presentation<\/a> of our product at the Urbit Hackathon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To complete the project, we also utilized 2 new techs for us: Hoon and Urbit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoon &#8211; is a strictly typed functional programming language that compiles itself to Nock and is designed to support higher-order functional programming without requiring knowledge of category theory or other advanced mathematics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Urbit &#8211; provides foundational primitives at the operating system layer, serving as a better platform for building networked, decentralized applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two points were new to our team, and we successfully mastered both of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CHALLENGES WE CONFRONTED<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We dealt with this project using an unfamiliar technology for us at that moment, introducing an element of risk. The Hoon programming language, specific to Urbit, posed a unique set of challenges, yet we were determined to overcome them. Additionally, we had to adhere to strict timelines imposed by the hackathon&#8217;s conditions, which added an extra layer of pressure to our development process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RESULT<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the crucible of the Urbit Hackathon, we emerged not only with a successful project but also with a profound mastery of Urbit&#8217;s intricate ecosystem and the unique challenges posed by the Hoon programming language. Our relentless pursuit of excellence led to the flawless implementation of the Zettelkasten method, seamlessly integrated into the Urbit environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who prefer to watch &#8211; enjoy the video of pitching of the project by Blaize representative Aleksei Korobeinikov below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Encode x Urbit Hackathon: Finale and Prizegiving\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Z8uq5f1sfdo?start=1869&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our participation in the Urbit Hackathon not only expanded our knowledge and expertise but solidified our position as leaders in the realm of innovative blockchain technologies.
