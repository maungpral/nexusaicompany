This is a film, television and music distribution portal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breaker introduces hundreds of entertainment enterprises and rights holders to Tokenomics and Smart Contracts via a TVOD platform that uses blockchain to automatically disperse royalties to rights holders when someone transacts on a piece of their content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform&#8217;s technology is built upon the Ethereum Blockchain and the ConsenSys venture production studio, and it relies on smart contracts to provide a transparent production and distribution system which bypasses traditional and monopolistic distribution systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This all shows where Breaker could spark some major innovations in the entertainment world through allowing artists greater control of production, distribution, and the data around distribution.&nbsp;<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jeffewing\/2018\/12\/20\/blockchain-blockbusters-breaker-and-the-promise-of-a-blockchain-studio\/?sh=2eaebe85526b\">Forbes<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WHAT WAS THE TASK?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main task was to expand the existing project architecture with a list of new features. Breaker itself is the content distribution platform which focuses on the video and series. It has a desktop app, mobile app, a lot of back-end functionality and the blockchain part. We put our efforts on the smart contracts development within the blockchain part and APIs which interferes with smart contracts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of smart contracts within the Breaker platform is to distribute the payment from video consumers to video creators. Therefore, every member of the team, which creates content, receives the appropriate part of every payment. First of all, we had to update the functionality to the up-to-date Solidity version and re-use modern approaches in smart contract development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"905\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme2.jpg\" alt=\"Breaker system for the funds flow\" class=\"wp-image-6351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme2.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme2-1536x869.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme2-1568x887.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><figcaption>Breaker system for the funds flow<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Though, <strong>Blaize was involved in expanding<\/strong><strong> the fund distribution system by adding new entities <\/strong>\u2013 investors, which hold the share in the product or video series, and investors which have constant investment. That reason, we have added recoupment functionality and expanded funds distribution among stakeholders of shares within created content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second task was to create APIs for communicating with newly created contracts. You can see on the scheme how Blaize team implemented the core APIs for communication with smart contracts for content tokenization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme1-1.jpg\" alt=\"The structure of created APIs\" class=\"wp-image-6354\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme1-1.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme1-1-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme1-1-1568x784.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><figcaption>The structure of created APIs<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PROJECT ARCHITECTURE<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts development has become an essential part of blockchain based projects. You need a very competent developer with the main specialization in blockchain because of the high security level and variety of functions that smart contract can perform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1274\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme3-1.jpg\" alt=\"Architectural scheme of Breaker contracts\" class=\"wp-image-6355\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme3-1.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme3-1-1536x1223.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/scheme3-1-1568x1249.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><figcaption>Architectural scheme of Breaker contracts<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Blaize programmers have enough technical skills and experience for smart contract development. In terms of Breakers case, our blockchain engineers made the smart contract expanding to have investors entities as you see on this scheme higher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong><em>NEED SKILLED BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPERS TO DEPLOY YOUR OWN SMART CONTRACT? GET TO KNOW MORE ABOUT OUR <\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/smart-contracts\/\"><em><strong>SMART CONTRACTS DEVELOPMENT SERVICES<\/strong><\/em><\/a><strong><em>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We had two separate parallel processes: one for smart contract development and the second for the APIs. So we had to engage our Solidity specialist and Node.js specialist.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole work was divided into several milestones:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; core logic update;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; funds distribution expanding to have USDC and ETH routes for distribution among holders of tokenized content;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; core APIs for communication with smart contracts for content tokenization;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; smart contract expanding to have investors entities;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; implementation of the recoupment functionality;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; implementation of fully new APIs for the application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CHALLENGES WE CONFRONTED<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main problem was the gas optimization &#8211; the regular issue for the Ethereum Solidity smart contracts. Consequently, we had distributed USDC and ETH among the large number of the holders in the most efficient way. We have succeeded by implementing several different contracts for different schemes of funds distribution. Also, we have added several (admin only) APIs for periodical calls for re-distributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second problem was correct handling of transaction calls and return values. Thus we have implemented the instance of RabbitMQ for querying, database instance for statuses keeping and several endpoints for communications with smart contracts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>RESULT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fully updated set smart contracts for content tokenization and funds distributed among shareholders. Implemented distributions for investors and recoupment functionality for tokenized content creators and fund distribution system expanded. Back-end service with transaction querying mechanism and connected database. Full set of endpoints for communications with smart contracts.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":6358,"template":"","clientcat":[362,359],"clientstage":[368],"clientblockchain":[357],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.9.1 -
