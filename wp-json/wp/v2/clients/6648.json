This project unites these parts: DeFi, play-to-earn rewards, and digital collectibles to revolutionize fantasy sports through tokens. The offer is simple: tokenized fantasy sports enable users to own the players that make up their team, and earn a share of a rewards pool based on team performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WHAT WAS THE TASK?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The development of a blockchain-based protocol for decentralized <strong>Nomo Fantasy Leagues <\/strong>was the main task. Nomo is an open-source protocol for decentralized fantasy sports. That&#8217;s why, this project combines IP, blockchain, the non-fungible ERC-721 tokens (\u201cNFT\u201d), and the ERC-20 tokens known as the Nomo Tokens (\u201c$NOMO\u201d).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the main task consisted of a smart-contract system that comprised of NFT token, oracle, fantasy league games, and strategy for earning yield from QuickSwap staking pools. Each token represents a specific sports player and reflects his weekly performance. As a result, users have the experience of purchasing, selling, and staking tokens. While staking tokens, they can win rewards based on the weekly yield pool and efficiency of a sports player.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PROJECT ARCHITECTURE<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nomo Fantasy League includes a smart-contract system that consists of NFTs, oracle, fantasy league games, and yield earning strategy. Each token represents a specific sports player and reflects that player\u2019s weekly performance. The league provides users with an experience of purchasing, selling, and staking tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/blog3-1.jpg\" alt=\"The scheme of Nomo Fantasy League architecture\" class=\"wp-image-6651\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/blog3-1.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/blog3-1-1536x1311.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/blog3-1-1568x1339.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><figcaption>The scheme of Nomo Fantasy League architecture<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a powerful Solidity team along with an experienced back-end, Subgraph specialists and several front-end developers. Our main milestones were:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>create Nomo NFT contract for handling sport players properties;<\/li><li>develop Nomo Leagues for staking NFTs as well as game performing reflection and rewards distribution;<\/li><li>develop yield strategy mechanic for earning rewards;<\/li><li>API integration of <a href=\"https:\/\/sportsdata.io\/\"><strong>SportsDataIO<\/strong><\/a>. This is the leading global sports data provider for collecting and distributing the fastest and most accurate data by covering tens of thousands of sporting events throughout the year, made available in easy-to-use formats;<\/li><li>implement Subgraph for collecting all historical smart-contracts data;<\/li><li>create a web app based on the design.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong><em>HAVE AN IDEA OF YOUR OWN CRYPTO GAME?

Also, this flow must be understandable to The Graph node, which has some limitations on the chosen network (Polygon).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next challenge was to design games contracts (Leagues) that will efficiently calculate points and rewards, also it must be modular to be able to handle separate leagues (and each league can have its own rules and rewards calculation).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>RESULT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end, we get a perfectly working blockchain-based Play-to-Earn fantasy sports platform. On this platform, players own NFTs that represent real world athletes and generate rewards based on the athletes&#8221; real world stats. By the way, players have already received their first rewards from the games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":6650,"template":"","clientcat":[365,354,353,345,362,359,343,338],"clientstage":[368],"clientblockchain":[357,464],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.9.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Decentralized App Development for the Crypto Game - Blaize<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"LeagueDAO is a decentralized open-source project which developed a tokenized fantasy sports protocol named Nomo Fantasy Leagues.
