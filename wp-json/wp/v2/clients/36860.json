Our next level of cooperation was to develop and implement leverage trading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TASK WHAT WAS THE TASK?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a further <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/clients\/limit-orders-implementation-for-omomo\/\">development of Limit orders<\/a>, we had decided to implement leverage trading based on integration with OMOMO Lending borrowing protocol and ref.finance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another goal was to test and present our idea within <a href=\"https:\/\/metabuild.devpost.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">METABUILD III Hackthon.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PROJECT OVERVIEW<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leverage trading in crypto allows investors to use borrowed funds to amplify potential returns. By opening larger positions than their initial capital, traders can benefit from price fluctuations. OMOMO&#8217;s leverage trading offers users the ability to open long or short positions, manage risk, and integrate with lending\/borrowing protocols and decentralized exchanges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chart below demonstrates the part of business logic of the leverage trading mechanics we implemented for OMOMO.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1272\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/omomo_1.svg\" alt=\"Part of business logic of the leverage trading mechanics\" class=\"wp-image-70940\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>WE AT BLAIZE PROVIDE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS FOR TRADING PLATFORM.

It\u2019s development started from a detailed release plan which was step-by-step implemented via the scrum approach. Initial we split delivery into three milestones. The target of our first milestone was an architectural barebone for the project and one user-ready feature for the hackathon. As such feature, we took a long position so we have to implement opening position, executing, canceling, and liquidating. It took us 4 two-weeks sprints to finish the functionality of 1st milestone and one more week to stabilize and deploy to testnet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second milestone included a short position and take profit order. Despite of few features included into milestone it took 6 sprints as Take profit order significantly affects all flows and required a lot of gas optimizations. And the last milestone was about testnet release and UI polishing for the product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Core team:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2 blockchain developers<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 backend developer&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 frontend developer&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 QA specialist&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 DevOps<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 Architect<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 PM.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>CHALLENGES WE CONFRONTED<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During development, we encountered many obstacles and challenges like gas optimization due to the extreme cost of cross-contract calls in NEAR, building failproof asynchronous architecture, integration with ref.finance smart-contract API and considering their limitation over maximal positions per user and so on. That was a thorny path that gave us a much deeper understanding of the NEAR ecosystem and leverage trading logic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Recently we finished a 12-month long development project for a blockchain-based platform.
