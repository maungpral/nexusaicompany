Other words, Compound is a lending platform.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protocol algorithms automatically derive the interest rate based on the supply and demand and thus allows users to benefit from floating asset rates. Such a system helps suppliers or borrowers to avoid unnecessary negotiations about payment terms, interest rates or collateral.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to act without additional intervention of counterparties (and pay their services) is one of the biggest advantages of DeFi in general. Each money market on Compound contains the full transaction record and is accessible for verification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1837\" height=\"656\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/compound_1.webp\" alt=\"Compound is a DeFi startup &amp; Ethereum-based open-source protocol \" class=\"wp-image-71023\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/compound_1.webp 1837w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/compound_1-1536x549.webp 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/compound_1-1568x560.webp 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1837px) 100vw, 1837px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Generally speaking, Compound\u2019s job is very similar to the traditional banking system, where you can deposit your fiat currency. As follows you earn a monthly or yearly rate while letting the others borrow your money through the bank institution as an intermediary party. With such protocols as Compound you can do the same action 24\/7 and benefit from additional features of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison to the traditional financial system, where the return rate is around 0%, with the Compound mechanism users can earn 5-10% annually on average, which makes it definitely one of the top DeFi projects on the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"WHAT-IS-AAVE\">What is <strong>AAVE<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/aave.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AAVE<\/a> is a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol that enables its users to lend and borrow digital assets and gain on the rate fluctuations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AAVE also provides lending pools similar to Compound markets. Yet, the distinctive feature of AAVE was the introduction of flash loans (as the first protocol on the market). Flash loans make the user experience more convenient and let to earn even more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flash loans give the possibility of taking an immediate loan from one of the pools without any collateral. In order to guarantee the safeness of such transactions, the loan has to be returned in one block. Otherwise, all actions made with it will be banned and invalid.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1346\" height=\"757\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/aave.webp\" alt=\"AAVE is the top defi startup\" class=\"wp-image-71026\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another greatness of AAVE is the ability to provide users with decentralized and secure crypto price data thanks to its integration with Chainlink oracle. This collaboration enables users to get accurate and on-time data from various on-chain and off-chain services. Thus, helps to ensure the reliability of the AAVE platform.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Thanks to its convenience and variability of useful features, AAVE has become favorable instantly and surely is one of the best DeFi security startups of this year. Since its recent launch in January 2020, the amount of assets held on this protocol has been growing by about 12 mils US dollars monthly.&nbsp;Read also our guide on <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/defi-security-how-to-prevent-your-defi-project-from-hacking\/\">how to prevent your smart contract from hacking<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"WHAT-IS-UNISWAP\">What is <strong>Uniswap<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among all startups in DeFi, this one is one of the most popular. <a href=\"https:\/\/uniswap.org\/\">Uniswap<\/a> is a big daddy of today\u2019s DeFi. It stands for decentralized Ethereum based protocol which allows users to safely exchange ERC-20 tokens based on the AMM mechanism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"747\" height=\"807\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/uniswap.webp\" alt=\"Uniswap is the most traded DeFi project\" class=\"wp-image-71029\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The distinctive feature of Uniswap is the lack of a traditional order book mechanism which has to determine the asset value. The whole workflow is maintained by smart contracts and AMM algorithms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AMM is an automated market maker that counts the exchange rate automatically using the \u201cconstant product market model\u201d. This allows to eliminate traditional order books and considerably faster the exchange process.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-light-gray-color has-text-color\"><strong>Haven\u2019t really understood what the AMM is? Don\u2019t worry, find this comprehensive guide on <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-amm-works-technology-basics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How the AMM technology works<\/a>?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It basically works as an exchange for cryptos, yet in order to make any action, you have to provide your own liquidity to the protocol first. Uniswap gathers tokens into pools where users can carry out a needed transaction. Additionally, in Uniswap users are able to earn from providing liquidity to the pools.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Uniswap works similarly to stock markets and uses contracts that combine Ether and certain tokens into a pool. While exchanging Ether for a token, the Ether goes to a contract pool, and token returns to a user. Such a mechanism allows providing secure and faster exchanges due to lack of counterparty involvement and necessity to wait for matching with anyone for price specifications.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"WHAT-IS-CURVE.FI\">What is <strong>Curve.fi<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.curve.fi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Curve<\/a> is a decentralized Ethereum based exchange. The mechanism here is similar to Uniswap, yet the idea is to change stablecoins only instead of Ether and tokens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Find out more about <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/understanding-stablecoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What Stablecoin Is<\/a> in this article<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The same as Uniswap, Curve uses an AMM algorithm that does not require a sell order to be matched by other orders which makes the Curve fully automated. Yet, unlike Uniswap, Curve uses a slightly different type of \u201ccurve\u201d. This helps to make autonomous exchanges 1:1 close rate with the approximate exclusion of slippage and minimal fees.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1641\" height=\"688\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/curve.webp\" alt=\"curve finance defi app for stablecoins \" class=\"wp-image-71031\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/curve.webp 1641w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/curve-1536x644.webp 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/curve-1568x657.webp 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1641px) 100vw, 1641px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-primary-red-color has-text-color\"><strong><em>If you are fascinated about the <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/amm-types-differentiations\/\">AMM types<\/a> but still a bit confused, we recommend looking into <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/amm-types-differentiations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this article<\/a> for more info.&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the creators of Curve provided its users with the ability to earn on the liquidity put in the pools. The cooperation with other DeFis enabled getting the most profitable interest rate among certain chosen tokens. It is possible due to rebalancing the basic token while at the same time, keeping the main stablecoin for its owner.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">Curve was the first protocol to provide a decentralized exchange for stablecoins which helped it to gather a lot of liquidity within a couple of months. Additionally, its unique pool balancing mechanism considerably reduces the slippage between the exchange rate which makes it resistant to such a big inconvenience as impermanent loss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Find out more about common DEX problems and alternative solutions to them in <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/overview\/amm-solutions-to-impermanent-loss-and-front-running\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this article<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"WHAT-IS-BALANCER\">What is <strong>Balancer&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/balancer.finance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Balancer<\/a> protocol was launched in March 2020 and is a representative of a young DeFis. Balancer is a crypto exchange protocol that works according to previously discussed automated market maker algorithms. Yet, it uses an alternative type of AMM named \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/amm-types-differentiations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">constant mean market maker<\/a>\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balancer is called among the best DeFi startups due to the number of distinctive advantages (like everyone else, it was developed as part of the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/for-startups\/\">development of a blockchain startup<\/a><\/strong>). In contracts to Uniswap it allows to trade against any existing token, not only ETH. The other thing is the ability to provide an unequal amount of tokens to the pool (like 60\/40 or even 95\/5), while keeping the mechanism balanced.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user is able to monitor the pool&#8217;s trading volume and the presence of available pools in the <a href=\"https:\/\/pools.balancer.exchange\/#\/explore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pool management dashboard<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1417\" height=\"568\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/balancer.webp\" alt=\"balancer new defi exchange constant mean market maker model\" class=\"wp-image-71033\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is the ability to create three types of pool within Balancer protocol. <strong>The first<\/strong> type is a private pool that belongs to the one specified user. The owner is the only one who can provide liquidity to the pool, and further manage the pool parameters.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The second<\/strong> type is a shared pool where every user can join and become a liquidity provider. The pool parameters such as fees, tokens, weights are set in advance so the pool creators cannot really influence them. To track the pool ownership balancer protocol introduced BPT token.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The next<\/strong> type stands for smart pool and is similar to the private one, but is managed by the smart contract. It allows to adjust the pool parameters and accept liquidity from any protocol user.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>Balancer&#8217;s main contribution is the introduction of flexible token swaps due to a unique market maker mechanism. Moreover, users do not benefit from the trading option only. They are able to earn profit and take part in protocol governing.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-primary-red-color has-text-color\"><strong>Having in mind a brilliant DeFi solution that will rock the market? <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/#contacts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Let\u2019s discuss<\/a> how to bring it to reality!<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"WHAT-IS-DY\/DX\">what is <strong>dY\/dX<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/trade.dydx.exchange\/margin\/ETH-DAI\">dYdX<\/a> is a margin trading platform, a new DeFi startup, which provides the ability to spot trading, lending and borrowing of crypto assets. Tho, this is not just another decentralized exchange.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem before dYdX creation was that the margin trading was limited only to CEXs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Binance<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kraken.com\/en-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kraken<\/a>. Therefore, the dYdX launch brought trading tools to another level.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1913\" height=\"703\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/dydx.webp\" alt=\"dydx defi dex exchange \" class=\"wp-image-71036\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/dydx.webp 1913w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/dydx-1536x564.webp 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/dydx-1568x576.webp 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1913px) 100vw, 1913px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>dYdX does not use an AMM algorithm to enable trading options like previously discussed Balancer, Uniswap and Curve. It is based on the traditional supply demand model, yet the trading process is carried out by the smart contract. This allows for faster and non-custodial transactions between users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">dYdX stands on the best DeFi startups list because is currently shows one of the highest volume and liquidity flows within DEXs.

Currently, there are more than 30 synthetic assets representing commodities like gold (etc.), fiats and crypto currencies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those synthetic assets (Synths) can be created while providing ETH and Synthetix\u2019s token SNX as collateral. Users can freely exchange Synths for other tokens as long as they are pure ERC-20 tokens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Synths have to be backed by SNX token with a Collateralization ratio equal to 750%. Holders are able to manage the ratio by burning or releasing Synths to achieve this.

As the first, it introduced Automated Clearing House (ACH) purchases in chosen US states.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dharma is integrated with Uniswap V2 and allows lending and borrowing of all assets available there. Yet, Dharma does not only open the crypto to new users. It can be very beneficial for the old DeFi traders as long as it provides a variety of advantages like<strong> gas fees coverage for all users.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, thanks to ACH support, Dharma app allows DeFi trading directly from your bank account. At the moment of purchase, the bank will charge a 1.5% commission for each transaction. The maximum size of purchases is established for $25000 per week.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong><em>\u201cMaking an investment in DeFi has, up until now, been a bifurcated and highly technical process.
