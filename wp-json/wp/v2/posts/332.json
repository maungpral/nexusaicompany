Yet, right after you decide to turn into this cutting edge market, the important question occurs: <strong>what is better in-house vs outsource blockchain development team?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, this is not a dilemma just for young entrepreneurs or new-born startups. Well-established mid-sized or large companies face the very same problem: maintenance and support of existing blockchain-based solutions that will drive their product or service to the heights it deserves.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we answer the common questions regarding in-house blockchain development vs outsourcing and explain their differences. Also, we will tell what type of businesses may benefit or lose from each of those solutions.&nbsp;Therefore, in the end, you can make an informed decision about what is best for your in-house or outsourcing model for blockchain development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pros and cons of in-house blockchain developers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do not know who to entrust the blockchain development &#8211; in-house or outsourcing, check out the benefits of both. Primary, every blockchain entrepreneur has to understand that hiring a dedicated blockchain development team will not be an easy task. As far as there is a high demand for skilled developers in this field, you have to prepare yourself for a desperate struggle for the heart of a good blockchain engineer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you finally found one, it might bring more control to your hands and increase the effectiveness of task fulfillment. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the list of the advantages and disadvantages of this model.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1005\" height=\"1076\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/blaze_291120.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7585\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros of in-house team<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Potentially better control over the process and final result<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the whole work process happens within your own company and is executed by your own employees, you have the ability to exercise better control over both the team and the development itself. Additionally, you are able to receive and immediate feedback from your engineers and react to it in a faster and more effective way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><strong>Higher expertise &amp; specialization in a particular subject area<\/strong><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Since internal specialists constantly deal with the same or similar scope of problems, they learn to master their skills better, becoming highly-focused professionals in this particular field. This may raise the quality of their work and the development process drastically.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Technical independence of the project<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally your project gains more technical independence from external experts in the case of in-house development. All key technical competencies remain within the company. This impacts not only the development process itself, but also tech support capabilities of the core team as well as the possibility to maintain the product\/service over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Immediate instructions and changes<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as you are in charge of the team, you are able to give immediate feedback and instruction regarding the working process or project scope itself. In terms of additional changes it helps to insert or discuss them nearly as soon as they come to your mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Product maintenance<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing an in-house blockchain development model may help to save time and costs in terms of further servicing and maintenance of your product. If the same team takes care of your product after the release, there is no need to spend time explaining what exactly is broken and how it should work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons of in-house&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Huge costs<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Building an effective and fully capable in-house dev team requires significant investment of both money and organizational efforts. This is highly visible especially at the initial stages (including paying a large amount of related costs like equipment, insurance, premises, social packages, taxes, etc).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus you will be spending money even at times of forced or natural inactivity (since your own staff need to be paid anyway). In most cases, an in-house blockchain dev team will cost you much more than any alternative option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Starving headhunters<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the high cost, there is even bigger risk of maintaining your own in-house devs. While your company has invested significant amounts of money into finding and raising internal specialists, they can always go away to the competition or to pursue their own projects, and your company will end up with needing to find and invest in new team members all over again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Limited expertise&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the other side of the coin in terms of higher specialization of your staff. Your own team becomes more and more narrowly specialized, which is good in terms of performance and effectiveness in one particular field.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in case external or internal fluctuations require any changes to be made, this could become a huge problem. As a result, your company lacks the needed flexibility and work speed that is so important to be on top of the market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, there may be a need for extra expenses for external specialists to handle your request.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Limited time<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for a good and experienced specialist in any area is a challenge while in blockchain you should triple the effort you put into it. Therefore, <strong>companies can spend months to years searching for skilled specialists.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Also: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/opinion\/top-10-blockchain-development-companies-for-2023\/\">Our Top of The Blockchain Development Companies<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who benefits from the in-house blockchain development team?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make a decision, you also need to understand who will benefit from in-house blockchain development and outsourcing. As you already know, if building an internal blockchain team, you have to be ready to get a lot out of your pockets along with committing much time for its building from the beginning. So the question is if the juice is worth the squeeze?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer depends on the purpose and, mainly, the size of the<strong> <\/strong>project you have in mind. <strong>Having an in-house blockchain development team is suitable in case of providing a huge product development.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/polkadot.network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Polkadot<\/a> is a good example of such a project. This is a very scalable product that will interact with a list of existing networks and new, upcoming projects. Therefore, it will surely require constant maintenance by a huge team of developers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong><em>Find out more about Polkadot ecosystem and its upcoming startups in <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/services\/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this article<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we have to underline that today it is approximately impossible to find a skilled senior blockchain developer due to such points as a quite young market in terms of blockchain adoption and lack of expertise in several blockchain technologies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now it is more common to find a developer with a good command in one or maybe two languages and some basic knowledge of the blockchain. Yet, for the development of a good product that is not enough so you will probably need to wait for several months or even a year for building a really skilled blockchain in-house team.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pros and cons of outsourcing blockchain development&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe that outsourcing blockchain development is better than in-house. Outsourcing has already proven its usability and cost-effectiveness for businesses of different types and sizes. Especially when talking about narrow markets where it is often hard to find good specialists for required tasks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is a fastly developing niche, and there are still not enough developers having strong technical knowledge and a few years of experience under their belts. So if finding a blockchain specialist is a difficult task, turning to outsource is a very wise idea.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reliable outsourcing blockchain company will have a team of experienced developers with a rich list of skills and can carry out various tasks. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the advantages of outsourcing blockchain development and its possible weaknesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1878\" height=\"959\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/blaze_291120_3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7583\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/blaze_291120_3.png 1878w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/blaze_291120_3-1536x784.png 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/blaze_291120_3-1568x801.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1878px) 100vw, 1878px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros of blockchain outsourcing:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Streamlined &amp; optimized development processes<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most crucial advantages of outsourced development. All development and accompanied business processes are well established and properly set up by the outsourcing developers team. This is something a young company lacks by definition since it is a newly created company with no pre-set processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Better TTM (Time To Market) index<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another big and important advantage of hiring a blockchain outsourcing company. An outsourced agency typically offers a ready-to-go highly experienced team without the need to go through time-consuming staffing processes. This helps to save a significant amount of time and effort. Thus you are able to deliver your vision to the market much faster and with less hassle.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Easier &amp; faster workforce scaling&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In case a situation requires fast or temporary team expansion you do not have to worry about hiring additional specialists. Outsourcing companies usually have specialists with a rich list of capabilities and experience. So you can seamlessly transfer another additional task to them, which is not the case if you do it all by yourself and in-house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cost-effectiveness&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is probably one of the most essential benefits of outsourced development that is very important for any kind of business, from a small new born startup to a large enterprise.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often external specialists will cost you significantly less than building your own in-house team. Potentially they will have more practical experience and your company can react faster and more effectively if an unusual problem arises.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Also: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-blockchain-and-ai-convergence-empowers-your-business\/\">Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Time-efficiency<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to a higher TTM index, outsourcing your blockchain development will also save the time needed for hiring and management of the team. In terms of outsourcing, you get a tight-knit team that is ready to take on your task. When in the case of in-house you will have to invest your time into the tiring processes of headhunting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>A rich list of tools &amp; technologies<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An outsourcing company often deals with projects from different spheres. Therefore its programmers can offer a wider list of skills and technologies they specialize in. You can also check the <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/clients\/\">company\u2019s portfolio<\/a> and see a case similar to your project to be sure they know how to do it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons of blockchain outsourcing:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Expertise stays outside the company<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An obvious drawback of dev outsourcing is that technical expertise comes from outside the company and stays out there. However, this may be not that critical if engineering itself is not the main area where your enterprise innovates. Or you can just outsource less critical and more trivial parts of your tech to an external contractor while keeping the key components for your own in-house specialists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Lesser control<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another issue that may occur while having an external team is a lack of direct communication with team members. This could lead to miscommunication and lesser transparency. This however could be fixed by choosing the right contractor and setting proper preliminary agreements on effective communication procedures, reporting, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong><em>See the thorough guideline on <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-to-choose-a-reliable-blockchain-company-for-your-project\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Choose a Reliable Blockchain Outsourcing Company<\/a> to know how to define the best from the rest<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Language barrier<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many companies work with specialists from all around the globe.

This may lead to longer discussions during the discovery stage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why hire an outsourcing blockchain development company?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is reasonable to outsource your blockchain project instead of opting for an in-house because of many factors. First of all, if you choose to outsource you will get a well-organized team with various skills and technologies in its portfolio.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second of all, experience with similar projects is also a huge advantage of outsourcing. Moreover, vast experience helps to enhance team creativity and flexibility of approaches they offer.
