Without this, creating a DeFi protocol is impossible. In open finance, they often represent complex and long codes, with broad protocol functionality encrypted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, a smart contract has to include all possible steps and actions the user can make. At the same time, everything should be transparent and secure which also adds additional complexity to the initial contract. The next thing is the reliability of the contract, as long as it deals with huge numbers of dollars, it has to be properly secured from hacking attacks. We have repeatedly solved such problems as part of the provision of <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/smart-contracts\/\"><strong>smart contract development services<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1400\" height=\"787\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/smart-contract-development-for-defi-project.png\" alt=\"smart contract development for defi project\" class=\"wp-image-7517\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As we said before, developing a <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/top-successful-defi-startups\/\"><strong>DeFi startup<\/strong><\/a> nowadays requires integration with other existing DeFis. So, the thing, in this case, is the complexity of other protocols you want to integrate with. Under these circumstances, engineers need to analyze and study this code carefully to ensure a reliable and safe integration. Otherwise, the money can be stolen or locked in a smart contract while swiping between two or more protocols.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That all contributes to difficulties in development and requires an experienced team of programmers specializing in Solidity as a prior.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 5 main problems, engineers face while developing DeFi project:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The burgeoning landscape of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) presents unique and exciting opportunities, but it also poses a multitude of intricate challenges for developers. To navigate this complex terrain and bring groundbreaking DeFi projects to life, a deep understanding of these hurdles and strategic mitigation strategies is essential. Here, we delve into five key challenges that developers must navigate:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Unwavering Security at Every Stage<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security reigns supreme in DeFi, where even the smallest vulnerability can lead to catastrophic consequences. A multi-layered approach is paramount, starting with comprehensive pre-launch audits by renowned security firms. However, the journey doesn&#8217;t end there. Continuous post-deployment monitoring utilizing advanced security tools is vital to detect and address emerging threats promptly. Additionally, regular penetration testing simulating real-world attacks further bolsters the project&#8217;s defenses. Therefore a <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/defi-security-how-to-prevent-your-defi-project-from-hacking\/\"><strong>DeFi security audit<\/strong><\/a> is required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contract security audit is an important part of the contracts united work testing and detecting <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/9-most-common-smart-contract-vulnerabilities-found-by-blaize\/\"><strong>smart contract vulnerabilities<\/strong><\/a> BEFORE any <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/analysis\/defi-hacks-in-2022-causes-cases-cautionary-tales\/\"><strong>hacked<\/strong><\/a> does so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>CONTACT BLAIZE IF YOU WANT TO GET A <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/security\/\">SMART CONTRACT SECURITY AUDIT <\/a>ASAP!<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. A Modular Architecture for Adaptive Evolution<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DeFi landscape is inherently dynamic, with new trends and opportunities emerging at a rapid pace. Protocols that fail to adapt risk becoming obsolete and losing valuable liquidity. A modular architecture allows for agile integration of new features and income streams as the market evolves. This flexibility empowers developers to respond swiftly to shifting user demands and capitalize on novel opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Bridging the Interoperability Divide<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Limiting a DeFi project to a single blockchain network significantly restricts its reach and potential. Cross-chain interoperability unlocks access to diverse user bases and liquidity pools across various ecosystems. While technical intricacies exist, embracing cross-chain solutions like bridges and atomic swaps expands the project&#8217;s horizons and fosters broader adoption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Blaize, we always use <a href=\"https:\/\/openzeppelin.com\/sdk\/\"><strong>OpenZeppelin<\/strong><\/a> SDK upgradable contracts possibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"944\" height=\"595\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/OpenZeppelin.png\" alt=\"OpenZeppelin upgrading smart contract\" class=\"wp-image-7518\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source:<em> <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/openzeppelin.com\/sdk\/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenZeppelin<\/a> SDK<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Its variety of tools and unique features always help to upgrade smart contracts and make it more readable and visually attractive.

Balancing Decentralization and Control<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralization lies at the heart of DeFi, yet navigating its inherent complexities can be challenging. Striking a balance between community governance and developer control is crucial. While empowering users through transparent and inclusive governance mechanisms is essential, unchecked democratic processes can lead to slow decision-making and suboptimal development paths. Carefully designed governance models that harness the wisdom of the community while ensuring efficient decision-making are key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The protocol needs to have its own governance token. One of the most important things regarding a token is its functionality. Functionality in this terms means it has to be used within the network and utilized by your community to be able to govern the protocol and get the rewards.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read how we built DAO &amp; governance token in <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-to-build-a-successful-defi-project\/\"><strong>snglsDAO <\/strong><\/a><strong>use case<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will incentivize the users in both ways \u2013 first of all, monetization. Due to token utilization, its capitalization will grow, so \u201cgetting reward\u201d in your governance token will lead to getting real money. Second of all, users will be able to use this token in DAO and, for instance, vote on protocol enhancements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Building a Resilient Ecosystem<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No DeFi project exists in isolation. While leveraging established protocols and aggregating liquidity can be advantageous, excessive dependence creates vulnerabilities. A diversified approach that mitigates reliance on any single external entity fosters resilience and protects against potential disruptions. Exploring alternative protocols and fostering organic liquidity growth are crucial aspects of ensuring long-term sustainability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By meticulously addressing these challenges and harnessing the power of innovative solutions, developers can unlock the immense potential of DeFi and contribute to the construction of a robust, inclusive, and thriving decentralized financial ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Project-Testing\"><strong>Project Testing&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unit tests and security audits are crucial for the proper work of your contracts. Yet, they are checking the formal logic and concentrating mainly on the smart contracts part of the project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to check the work of the whole system, we recommend providing a full project system test. Therefore, in this part, we are going to share some tips on how to test your decentralized finance project properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While unit tests and security audits form the bedrock of reliable smart contracts, they only paint a partial picture. Assessing the holistic functionality of your entire DeFi project requires a more comprehensive approach: end-to-end testing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unit tests excel at verifying individual contract logic, while security audits identify potential vulnerabilities. However, they often lack the ability to evaluate how these components interact within the broader system. End-to-end testing fills this crucial gap, ensuring seamless integration and frictionless user experience across all project elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before venturing onto the mainnet, thoroughly testing your project in a controlled environment is paramount. Local testing, utilizing tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/trufflesuite\/ganache\"><strong>Ganache<\/strong><\/a> for creating a personal Ethereum network <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/which-blockchain-to-fork-to-start-your-own-cryptocurrency\/\"><strong>fork<\/strong><\/a>, offers several advantages:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A private testing ground, independent of the live mainnet, minimizes risks and allows for controlled experimentation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Developers can freely manipulate addresses and configurations, facilitating comprehensive functionality testing.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No real-world transaction fees incur, making it a cost-efficient testing framework.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The other way is to test your DeFi protocol on public testnets which are available and accessible by anyone. The only thing with those is that not all of the existing DeFi protocols are presented there.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While local testing provides a controlled sandbox, replicating real-world conditions for comprehensive testing necessitates venturing into the realm of public testnets. Popular options like Ropsten and Kovan offer valuable advantages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Public testnets may not mirror the full spectrum of DeFi protocols present on the mainnet. This creates a gap where connections to critical functionality are absent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To overcome this obstacle, developers can leverage stubs. These are lightweight mockups of missing DeFi protocols, replicating their interfaces and behaviors as closely as possible within the testnet environment. While not perfect substitutes, they effectively simulate real-world interactions and enable comprehensive testing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ideal testnet setup goes beyond individual stubs. Aim to replicate the actual user experience as closely as possible:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Prepare a Beta-like Environment: Set up the testnet to closely resemble your intended mainnet deployment in terms of configuration, resources, and network conditions. This fosters a realistic testing environment for user interactions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stress Test Performance: Simulate peak user loads and unexpected scenarios to assess your project&#8217;s ability to handle real-world challenges.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Integrate Real-World Data: If possible, introduce data feeds and mock oracles mirroring actual market conditions for an even more realistic testing experience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, a well-prepared testnet acts as a crucial bridge between development and a successful mainnet launch. By investing in a comprehensive testbed, you ensure your DeFi project is thoroughly vetted, robust, and ready to thrive in the real world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>ANYWAY, LOCALLY OR ON THE TESTNET, YOUR PROJECT HAS TO BE TESTED IN CONDITIONS CLOSE TO REAL. NO TESTING ON PRODUCTION.<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>NOT ONLY SMART CONTRACTS&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The contemporary DeFi landscape extends far beyond smart contracts. A robust, multifaceted ecosystem underpins seamless user experience and project success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The essential components of a successful and reliable DeFi protocol include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitive User Interfaces: Seamless integration with cutting-edge wallets fosters a frictionless user interaction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Data-Driven Insights: Backend infrastructure and subgraph integration meticulously aggregate user data and on-chain information for insightful visualizations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Streamlined Automated Workflows: Efficiently execute routine tasks through automation, enhancing operational efficiency.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reliable Price Feeds: Leverage trustworthy oracles and price feeds to guarantee accurate data for informed decisions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scalable Infrastructure: We create a robust foundation that fosters your project&#8217;s growth and long-term sustainability.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Prioritizing user experience is paramount. We recommend emphasizing key user-centric metrics, such as APY.
