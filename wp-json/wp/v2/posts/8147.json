The language was created with blockchain technology in mind, so it is aimed to be secure and versatile while providing all the necessary tools for convenient and fast dApps development, as well as supporting the unique features of the Internet Computer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motoko provides native support for the Internet Computer canisters (smart contracts), sequential style, simple modern coding style, and multiple features to help you leverage orthogonal persistence. All of these features make it an easy and safe language for the Internet Computer ecosystem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read also: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/blockchain-in-healthcare-opportunities-and-risks-of-using-blockchain-technology\/\">Blockchain in Healthcare<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Motoko Advantages<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Automatic memory management;<\/li><li>Productivity and safety features;<\/li><li>Built-in support for orthogonal persistence;<\/li><li>Fixed-precision arithmetic.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Internet Computer<\/strong> \u2013 a modern public blockchain that allows for deploying secure, autonomous, and tamper-proof canisters (smart contracts) and running them at web speed.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choose Motoko if you want your project to be a part of the DFINITY ecosystem.

As well, one shouldn\u2019t forget about the traditional ones: Java, JavaScipt and Python that also perfectly fit for web3 development needs. According to Blaize experience, Rust suits blockchain development purposes best since it enables productive collaborative work, provides clear development guidelines and offers high speed, stability, and overall efficiency. However, you should choose the blockchain language based on the ecosystem for your project in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is the best blockchain programming language?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best languages for blockchain development include Rust, Go, C++, Solidity, and Motoko.

Over 200K developers worldwide choose Solidity for its great accessibility, flexibility, and precision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to choose a suitable blockchain coding language for a DeFi project?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When building a DeFi product from scratch, you should start by choosing the ecosystem for your project, which will help you select the best-fit blockchain programming language. Decide on where you\u2019d like to see your project, which \u201cneighbors\u201d and potential partners you want to have, and which opportunities you want to enable for users and developers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>If you\u2019d like to avoid any headache, <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/\">contact the Blaize team<\/a> to get a free extensive consultation on blockchain development and get a custom solution made specifically for your project.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where can I find professional blockchain developers?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for highly qualified engineers with hands-on experience in programming languages for developing blockchain-based products, the best option is to hire a ready-made outsourced team. <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/\">Blaize<\/a> has been focusing on custom blockchain development for over five years, growing the team and expanding our expertise. Contact us today for a consultation and get your task done in the next few weeks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What do you need to learn in order to start developing on the blockchain?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To start developing on the blockchain, you initially need a deep understanding of cryptographic principles and decentralized architectures. Mastering a blockchain-specific programming language, such as Solidity for Ethereum or Rust for Polkadot, is paramount. Familiarity with distributed ledger concepts, consensus algorithms (like PoW or PoS), and smart contract mechanics is crucial. Furthermore, hands-on experience with development tools and frameworks, such as Truffle or Hardhat for Ethereum, will facilitate a smoother entry into practical development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Move vs Solidity. What&#8217;s the key points here?\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Move and Solidity are both perfect languages for blockchain development but both of them have certain features. Solidity, Ethereum&#8217;s flagship language, is contract-oriented, widely adopted, and has a JavaScript-like syntax, making it accessible to many developers. In contrast, Move, developed for Facebook&#8217;s Diem (formerly Libra), introduces the concept of &#8220;resources&#8221;, which ensures assets are non-fungible and can&#8217;t be duplicated, thereby enhancing security. While Solidity compiles into EVM bytecode, Move bypasses some abstraction layers, executing directly on its native Move Virtual Machine, ensuring efficiency. The choice between the two languages depends on the specific use-case, desired blockchain platform, and security considerations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The blockchain
