The stability of a price can be embodied in different ways. The most common one is backing the coin by other assets, so the emission of stablecoin is simultaneously stimulated and bounded by the finite collateral liquidity. In this terms we differentiate:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>crypto-backed stablecoins&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>fiat-backed stablecoins<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>commodity-backed stablecoins&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><em>Blaize has been sharing a thorough explanation of those in the article about <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/understanding-stablecoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">types of stablecoins<\/a>. Check it for a deeper understanding of the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is a type of stablecoins that does not require any collateral, meaning <strong>algorithmic stablecoin<\/strong>. This helps to achieve the required decentralization, which is a big issue in terms of classic collateral-backed stable assets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike previous examples, algorithmic stablecoin does not rely on any real asset while stability is modeled algorithmically. The set of smart contracts regulates the value of such stablecoin by managing supply with applied algorithms. You can see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ampleforth.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ampleforth<\/a> as a living example of this type.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read also: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/9-most-common-smart-contract-vulnerabilities-found-by-blaize\/\">Types of Smart Contracts Vulnerabilities<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>This type of stablecoin requires the most complicated development toolset with previous experience in blockchain and smart contracts in particular. This is highly important when choosing the type of stablecoin you want to create and reliable stablecoin developers. Read <\/strong><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-to-choose-a-reliable-blockchain-company-for-your-project\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong><em>how to find a solid blockchain outsourcing company<\/em><\/strong><\/a><em><strong> for such a task.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"CHOOSE-THE-TARGET-BLOCKCHAIN-PLATFORM\"><strong>Choose the target blockchain platform&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After you get an understanding of what type of stablecoin your project needs, there is a place for considering the best platform for its implementation. The first thing to mention is that this is not a far 2016 when Ethereum was considered as one and only.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market has plenty of blockchains hosting stablecoins of different types. Stellar, EOS and TRON blockchains are the first to overtake Ethereum.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Read more specifications of mentioned blockchains in <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Best Platforms for Blockchain Development<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a number of advantages like low transaction costs or higher scalability the third generation blockchains are seemed to be a very attractive place for stablecoin development. Thus, such giants as Tether (USDT) decided to run on TRON and EOS besides Ethereum. In addition, EOS is hosting such stablecoin projects as Carbon (CUSD), <a href=\"https:\/\/eosdt.com\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EOSDT<\/a> and EUSD.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the main question regarding choosing the right platform to launch a stablecoin should cover the demand occurring within this particular blockchain ecosystem. To clarify this notion, you can issue a stablecoin on any existing blockchain, but the project will not gain a lot of success because of low demand or the wrong use case of the coin. That is why we recommend preparing a thorough business analysis and do not omit the discovery stage during project planning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, building a stablecoin on the Ethereum platform seems very reasonable for a <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/token-development-services\/\">token development firm<\/a><\/strong> due to a robust infrastructure and usage of ERC-20 token standard. Ethereum has the biggest ecosystem with high demand for custom currencies which will ensure constant and sustainable liquidity flow for your stablecoin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Ethereum is a home for almost all DeFi protocols which significantly increases the need for stablecoins. Those who are pegged to ETH (like DAI) have shown <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/what-to-expect-blaize-predictions-of-blockchain-development-trends-in-2021\/#STABLECOINS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">great results last year<\/a> and the demand is expecting to grow accordingly to Ethereum 2.0 transitions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"mb-0 has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><em>To sum up this part, while choosing the right blockchain platform to <\/em><em>launch a stablecoin<\/em><em> the main focus should be turned to the supply and demand volume desired for your project. It is worth noting, that if you want to <\/em><em>create your own decentralized stablecoin<\/em><em> (like Dai or Ampleforth) you should remember that it will be tied to the chosen blockchain.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><em>Then, the possibility of moving it to another network will either be absent or will be extremely limited. In case of creating centralized stablecoin (like Tether or PAX) on EOS, TRON or other blockchain you will need an additional bridge to be able<\/em><em> to run an Ethereum stablecoin<\/em><em>. In this case, you are not limited by the choice, but it may take more time and require more skills for the development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"IDENTIFY-STABLECOIN-DEVELOPMENT-APPROACH\"><strong>Identify stablecoin development approach&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This step requires an understanding of the needed trust mechanism you want to implement in your stablecoin architecture. In further explanation, <strong>the trust mechanism establishes the rules under which the price for the coin stays stable and the emission supports that stable price<\/strong>. This is very crucial in terms of understanding the level of decentralization you want to achieve.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each approach to stablecoin development corresponds to different purposes and the client\u2019s specifications on how to make a stablecoin. Let\u2019s describe them for a deeper understanding.&nbsp;But before you get started, learn more about the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/nft-development-services\/\">NFT token development<\/a><\/strong> process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">1. <b>Create your own blockchain&nbsp;<\/b><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first way is to create your own blockchain and make a stablecoin on top of it. You can see Celo blockchain with its <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.celo.org\/celo-codebase\/protocol\/stability\/doto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cUSD stablecoin<\/a> as an example of this approach.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"882\" height=\"520\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/0aQgCUQCRU-2TGTO6.png\" alt=\"building a stablecoin on ethereum\" class=\"wp-image-33039\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Celo stability protocol contraction<\/em>, source: <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/celoorg\/arbitrage-and-winning-a-cryptocurrency-trading-competition-at-mit-32e183766e42\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Celo blog<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">2. Create decentralized stablecoin<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach means creating a stablecoin algorithm from scratch using one of the existing blockchains. The issue of coins will be ensured by <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/smart-contracts\/\">smart contracts which we develop and provide as a service<\/a>. The trust mechanism in this case relies on the contract logic and is secured by it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, we can define DAI stablecoin based on MakerDAO protocol or any other ETH pegged coins. So we recommend considering this development approach if you need to create a stablecoin on Ethereum.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/0fqbc6qjaqWj7UYUV.jpg\" alt=\"create an Ethereum stablecoin\" class=\"wp-image-33041\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>DAI emission cycle scheme<\/em>, source <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/hackernoon\/dai-a-decentralized-opposition-to-the-banking-cartel-of-stablecoins-accumulates-1-7-763461bc2008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hackernoon<\/a>&nbsp;<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">3. Create trustable centralized stablecoin&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is used for developing the majority of stablecoins and Tether is the most prominent example. The idea is to make a simple ERC-20 contract on Ethereum that issues stablecoins.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One should consider this approach if it needs to benefit from blockchain advantages while having guarantees of stability provided by fiats.<\/strong> The trust mechanism then relies on the rule that the private key of the deployer belongs to the single person (script on the backend actually) who has the right to generate new coins. The full decentralization of your currency is very questionable in this case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">4. Adoption through the intermediate case&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another approach to stablecoin launch can be its adoption through the intermediate solution. This case was perfectly performed by Binance exchange. BUSD (Binance initial stablecoin) was created inside the exchange as an intermediate coin in order to match trading pairs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then it was moved to BinanceChain through the creation of an app that wraps fiat and emits stablecoins in exchange and now acts as an independent stablecoin. After BUSD reached out from its native chain to Ethereum, many well-known DeFi services like Uniswap, 1Inch, Curve, Kyber, etc. started BUSD support.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">Find out more about <\/span><\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/top-successful-defi-startups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\"><em>successful DeFi startups<\/em><\/span><\/a><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\"> in our previous article.&nbsp;<\/span><\/em><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">5. Use existing cryptocurrency<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an alternative approach to the listed above, we can mention re-using existing <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/analysis\/how-to-create-your-own-cryptocurrency-from-a-to-z\/\">cryptocurrency as a base to build<\/a> an Ethereum stablecoin (or any other). The requirement for stablecoin usage within your business-case does not always mean the creation of the coin from scratch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/ethereum-based-dapp-development-for-trading-platform\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">building a dApp on Ethereum<\/a>, you can re-use one of the existing currencies, since addresses of the most popular stablecoin contracts are known and trustable.
