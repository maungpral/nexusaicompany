This is especially crucial if you have never outsourced the development process to a third party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first of all, what you\u2019d wanna do is create a list of the fundamental details of your project. It should include the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>the main idea of your project<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>the problem your project solves<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Its competitive advantages \u2013 why it is better than other existing solutions&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>any suggestions for the preferable concept and blockchain frameworks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend clarifying all this information before scheduling calls with potential contractors and even before doing research. This way, you will not waste your time and will get right to what you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have no idea about blockchain frameworks to be used, think through the functionality of your project and any future collaborations.
