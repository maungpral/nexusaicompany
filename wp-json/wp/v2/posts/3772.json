We would like to share more technical aspects regarding each type next.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Blaize\u2019s team of blockchain developers has been studying the unique technical specifications of the Polkadot ecosystem for a few years. We are currently working on several projects to launch on the network in the near future. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/blaize_tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Follow Blaize<\/a> news updates to see future case description in detail.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"BUILDING-A-PARACHAIN-TO-POLKADOT\">Building a parachain to Polkadot<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before considering this approach and starting parachain development, <strong><em>let\u2019s define what a parachain is<\/em><\/strong> and why it is different from running an independent blockchain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Polkadot provides a highly scalable and secure ecosystem of blockchains. Yet, those blockchains are actually parachains. The main difference between them lies in <strong>shared security<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any created parachain has to be connected to the Relay Chain (the main chain of Polkadot). Along with this connection, the Relay chain will provide the parachain security and a guarantee of secure cross-chain communication (<a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.polkadot.network\/docs\/learn-xcm-transport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">XCMP<\/a>) between all connected parachains in the system. <em>Thus, the Polkadot ecosystem ensures the desired interoperability and scalability of all chains together.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Polkadot Parachain Development<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a claim that creating a Polkadot parachain requires a strong knowledge of Substrate. Substrate as well as Polkadot are written in the Rust language. Consequently, you can implement parachain development in Rust.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From another perspective, generally, you can implement a custom blockchain development in any language (C++, Go or Java). If a certain interface is respected you can connect it as a parachain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, in order to ease development, Polkadot provides PDKs (which stands for Parachain Development Kit). Currently, there are two functioning PDKs which are <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/paritytech\/substrate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Substrate<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/paritytech\/cumulus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cumulus<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parity Substrate is a cutting-edge solution that allows for building a complex blockchain architecture within a short period of time. This reduces Polkadot development time significantly from years to weeks. So we recommend using the ready-made Substrate framework for building a parachain instead of writing initial <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/5-best-programming-languages-for-blockchain-development\/\">coding<\/a> in Rust, Go, or others.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><em>Previous working experience with Substrate will be a huge plus. Get to know more about the Substrate framework and its characteristics in <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development\/#PARITY-SUBSTRATE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Best Blockchain Platforms comparison<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The basic set of tools for Polkadot parachain development:<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Substrate 2.0.0.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Polkadot source code&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/paritytech\/wasmi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WASM interpreter<\/a> and compiler to WASM<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rococo&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to set up the latest version of the Substrate framework. The best way is to use Parity Knowledge Base. As soon as the environment is prepared, we can start to modify the live version of the parachain template code. The initial code can be taken from the Polkadot repository <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/paritytech\/polkadot\/tree\/master\/roadmap\/implementers-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/6d8df098600232750cc677f9d8617649.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p>Substrate technology contains all the necessary modules and frames for an independent chain development. But it does not have the required compatibility feature with Polkadot.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Therefore, as soon as the main chain architecture is done, you need to start using the <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/paritytech\/cumulus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cumulus<\/a><strong> library. <\/strong>Cumulus will add the required parachain code while importing a Substrate-based chain to the library. Thus, it makes it compatible with the Polkadot environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to check a new-build parachain, we need a testnet examination. One of the major Polkadot testnets, <a href=\"https:\/\/polkadot.js.org\/apps\/?rpc=wss:\/\/rococo-rpc.polkadot.io#\/settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rococo<\/a>, has been created to meet the specifications of <em>parachains testing<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing you will need a parachain slot to deploy your chain and connect to the Relay chain. The project will need to acquire one of the parachains\u2019 slots in the auction that will take place shortly. But take into account, you can test and deploy your parachain on <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021\/#KUSAMA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kusama<\/a> (Polkadot cousin).\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"DEVELOP-A-DAPP-ON-POLKADOT\">Develop a dApp on Polkadot&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Claiming a breakthrough in operability and scalability Polkadot attracts a lot of minds eager to build dApps on Polkadot within its network. It is especially attractive for open finance developers seeking to create a full market of DeFi on Polkadot (read about <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/overview\/top-notch-defi-derivatives-you-should-know-about\/\"><strong>DeFi derivatives<\/strong><\/a>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you should know is that the Polkadot Relay chain itself does not support any Polkadot smart contract framework. However, the arbitrary state transitions inserted into parachains do offer such support. This technology will be released shortly and will allow for building dApps on a Polkadot parachain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Also: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/overview\/amm-solutions-to-impermanent-loss-and-front-running\/\">How to Avoid Impermanent Loss and Front-running Problem in DeFi<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, it is recommended to use one of the existing technologies and prepare your future Polkadot dApp to be ready when the parachain starts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts are a core for any decentralized application development. The Polkadot system is very complex and tiered, but there are a few ways to deploy smart contracts on Polkadot:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Develop smart contracts in any language compiled to WASM (Java, Go, etc.)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Develop dApp using Substrate EVM pallet&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Develop dApp using Substrate <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/thesephist\/ink\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ink<\/a> contracts pallet&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We will use the third approach to provide an example of dApp development for smooth integration with a Polkadot parachain in the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Example of dApp development on Substrate-based chain&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to wider adoption of Substrate and its growing demand, we would like to show the example of using Substrate FRAME for building a dApp for Polkadot.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The basic set of tools for (Polkadot) dApp development:<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Substrate 2.0.0.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rust<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>!Ink<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/paritytech\/wasmi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WASM interpreter<\/a> and compiler to WASM<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Substrate FRAME is a code library storing ready-made modules (or otherwise pallets) to build your custom blockchain with Substrate. To create a decentralized app on top of it, one needs to combine chosen modules into the \u201cruntime\u201d of the framework.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to enable smart contract functionality we should add a <em>_contracts <\/em>pallet.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/420c26142b5e94a895a50f0341716896.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p>For customization, we can add all necessary imports and dependencies, develop on Polkadot custom traits within this pallet or even add more custom pallets and start the configuration.<\/p>\n\n\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/26eafdb3bc3ffcfcaa0b2b66dc655df0.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, you can think of deploying Polkadot smart contracts for your dApp to the live environment. Currently, there are two leading solutions that offer smart contracts running via the Polkadot environment: Moonbeam and Edgeware.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edgeware is a Substrate-based chain that will connect to the Relay Chain as one of the Polkadot parachains in the near future. It enables smart contracts on Polkadot to run with its further compilation to WASM. Edgeware is a perfect solution to try out the contracts made with the contracts\u2019 pallet from the Substrate FRAME library.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you have chosen the Substrate EVM pallet, think of a Moonbeam smart contract solution. It uses an interoperable layer containing the current Ethereum toolset called <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/paritytech\/frontier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Frontier<\/a>.

There are basically two options: create a bridge for your current solution, or provide bridge-as-a-service between two existing decentralized protocols.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a technical point of view, a cross-chain bridge is an app for a token \u201ctransfer\u201d between two blockchains. The transfer is made through smart contracts on both sides of the bridge and a decentralized network of independent validators.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The cross-chain bridge idea implies that tokens are moving (or transferring) between chains or protocols. But in fact, when a money transfer request occurs, the contract burns tokens on one chain and mints them on the other.&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">There is a feature when the contract locks tokens instead of burning them if the initial token contract does not provide a <em>burning function. <\/em>Those specifications might be hard to detect for a less experienced blockchain developer.

That is why the bridge is quite similar to the way a multisig contract functions. When a money transfer request goes to one of the contracts, the relayers (validators) ought to create a vote on this transaction and approve token minting on the opposite side of the bridge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read also:<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/amm-types-differentiations\/\">AMMs models<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Building a bridge using Substrate&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Substrate framework provides a full collection of components and pallets for building bridges.

This should take into account such parameters as the number of validators (relayers) and the established threshold for them. The threshold is the limit of required validators to approve the transaction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, in case there are five relayers for this bridge, and the threshold amount is three, the transaction will be approved after three confirmations occur with no need to wait for the rest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The daily limit is another substantial element of the validator\u2019s program development.
