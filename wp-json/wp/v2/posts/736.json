Essentially, the execution process takes three steps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>The contract is written in <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/5-best-programming-languages-for-blockchain-development\/\">computer code<\/a><\/strong>. The agreement is codified into the blockchain \u2014 note that the parties of the contract are anonymous, although the agreement is stored as a public ledger.<\/li><li><strong>A trigger event occurs and a smart contract auto-executes<\/strong>. As soon as the specified date is reached or a condition is matched, the agreement will be executed with no human supervision in a way stated in the initial terms.<\/li><li><strong>Regulating institutions can refer to the contract<\/strong> confidently since the document is transparent and tamper-proof. Meanwhile, the original actors of the agreement don\u2019t have to worry about revealing their identities.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Smart-Contracts-vs-Standard-Contracts\">Smart Contracts vs Standard Contracts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Contractual agreements are one of the oldest known ways to formalize the agreement between to parties protecting both. However, lately, traditional paper-based contracts have a list of vulnerabilities since they are easy to bypass, take a lot of time to agree upon, and are expensive to create and store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, as technology evolved,  and more organizations adopt blockchain smart contracts concept.

As part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/security\/\">smart contract audit services<\/a>, we have applied this many times in different industries.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Also: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-blockchain-and-ai-convergence-empowers-your-business\/\">Blockchain and AI Convergence<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the frontrunner industries in terms of implementing smart contracts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">E-commerce<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In e-commerce, smart contracts would contribute to creating an environment for risky purchases. For instance, when a customer checks out on the website, the payment for the purchase is held on the public ledger. A seller will get access to the money after the product is shipped and delivered safely.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Asset management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts will come in handy when processing and creating mortgage loan agreements. As a rule, mortgage contracts are multi-layered and complex \u2014 that\u2019s why companies hire multiple middle-men to not miss out on significant details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts simplify the process of asset managers for the loan applicant and the property seller alike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one thing, they help cut off intermediaries, reducing the amount of time needed to sign the contract and the cost of elaborating a working agreement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, being able to store all the details of the agreement in one place securely makes it easier for parties to refer to the agreement in future negotiations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Insurance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurance industry is quite slow when it comes to automation \u2014 that\u2019s why processing claims can drag on for weeks. By implementing smart contracts, insurance companies can increase the number of processed claims, cut unnecessary operating costs, and improve customer satisfaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability of smart contracts to execute automatically will increase the efficiency of processing natural disaster claims. Such agreements allow you to be precise about the specifications regarding the amount of damage and a respective compensation \u2014 paper-based documents don\u2019t allow such a high level of detail.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Employment contracts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The employees of multinational corporations often feel unprotected since there\u2019s no way for them to win a court case against an employee with considerably more money and human resources. After smart contracts are adopted, a job candidate, as well as the employer, can only agree to the conditions that protect both parties\u2019 personal rights and ensure fair treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, the contract will be executed on its own \u2014 there\u2019s no way for an employee to modify it or read the document differently than originally intended. Smart contracts create a valuable record database where the salary and responsibilities of every employee are documented in detail, increasing transparency within the workplace.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Intellectual property ownership<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to claim ownership over something when the content is being redistributed continuously all over the web is a challenge modern creators have to deal with. Now that many new forms of content are rising \u2014 videos, online posts, and others, regulatory bodies have to come with ways to trace intellectual property ownership efficiently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As smart contracts are tamper-proof, they are a way to set one\u2019s ownership over a piece of content in stone. Also, such an agreement can automatically detect the breach of conditions and auto-execute countermeasures.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Also: <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/top-successful-defi-startups\/\">T<strong>op DeFi Startups<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Supply chain<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The supply chain is a complex domain with multiple parties involved. That\u2019s why it\u2019s especially hard to keep track of what\u2019s happening every step of the delivery process, determine the root cause of potential errors, and find a person liable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts monitor and record compliance with the agreements for every party involved. In case a vendor or a car driver does not follow the instructions he had previously agreed to, it will be recorded in blockchain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than enhancing transparency and promoting trust between the vendor, the seller, and the end client, smart contracts increase the visibility of delivered goods. Since the blockchain checks the condition of a delivery over multiple stages, this data can be used to find a lost item.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>As you can see, blockchain technology and smart contract adoption, in particular, find themselves very useful in a variety of industries nowadays.

These agreements can be adopted universally, for any type of transaction across multiple domains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a public office official or a business manager, you will be able to reap significant benefits from smart contract adoption, both in the short and the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let&#8217;s look at the main advantages of smart contracts:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Time-efficiency<\/strong>. Elaborating, agreeing upon, and enforcing a paper-based contract usually takes weeks. The process is dragged on due to the reliance on multiple intermediaries and a huge feedback loop. Using blockchain smart contracts  require no legal compliance and no need to reach out to lawyers since they don\u2019t require the intervention of the court to be enforced.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Security<\/strong>. As smart contracts use data encryption, they are one of the safest ways to ensure no third party can modify the document. Thanks to high-level security, smart contracts have significant potential implications for international relations and political agreements (find out <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/services\/how-to-boost-smart-contract-security-and-mitigate-risks-in-defi\/\">how to boost smart contract security<\/a><\/strong>).&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Precision<\/strong>. A smart contract is more flexible and accounts for a higher level of detail than its paper counterpart. Such an agreement can process a list of elaborate conditions and choose the right scenario for execution out of dozens of others. Also, there\u2019s no human error during the execution of the agreement \u2014 thus, the odds of deviations from the agreement are lower.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Money savings<\/strong>. Smart contracts don\u2019t require the parties to hire intermediaries for negotiations. They are easier to store, don\u2019t require printing, don\u2019t take up physical space.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Transparency<\/strong>. When elaborating on a smart contract, both parties get to go through the littlest details. Hence, there\u2019s no risk of missing out on important points or misunderstanding each other. Thanks to its tamper-resistance, a smart contract evokes more trust from both parties that are signing it.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>Thinking of smart contract technology implementation, but not sure where to start? <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/#contacts\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Blaize<\/a> and get a thorough <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/consulting\/\" target=\"_blank\">idea validation<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Smart-Contract-Adoption-Case-Studies\">Smart Contract implementation examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/pasted-image-0-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7971\" width=\"524\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/pasted-image-0-2.png 1600w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/pasted-image-0-2-1536x960.png 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/pasted-image-0-2-1568x980.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the concept of smart contracts implementation has been discovered just a few years ago, companies have already started the adoption process.

When it comes to paper-based documentation, the compliance is tracked by a regulatory body. A similar system has to be adopted for blockchain contracts. If a car owner signed a contract with an insurance firm, a trusted service has to send an alert when an insurance case is detected to enforce the contract.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read also: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/9-most-common-smart-contract-vulnerabilities-found-by-blaize\/\">Most Common Smart Contract Vulnerabilities<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure the reliability of blockchain, smart contract teams are encouraged to create a chain of arbitration organizations that pay a regular guarantee fee and are refunded in case a regulatory body makes a wrong enforcement decision.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Example<\/em><\/strong><em>: A car owner got into an accident. 10 independent representatives are called upon to determine if the insurance can cover the accident.
