Only by taking into account these factors, will you be able to choose the most suitable blockchain network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have created this guide for you to have a better grasp of the most popular chains for dApp development and make a well-grounded decision. And by \u201cwe\u201d we mean Blaize \u2013 the team of professional blockchain developers, auditors, and security experts that have been working in this field for over 5 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\">So far, our team has <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/clients\/\">completed over 70 projects<\/a> and spent extra 800+ hours on grant development for different programs.

Yet, only a few of them prove their viability and get a positive ROI after launch.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This happens because such a competitive market as blockchain or DeFi does not only require fresh, creative solutions, but needs a well-developed business idea for the project to achieve success. Only these kinds of products have a potential, can bring a real profit to the users and the company, and provide a more cost-effective solution to the market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, before choosing the right blockchain platform, we often insist on conducting a business analysis and <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/consulting\/\">idea validation<\/a> of the client\u2019s initial concept. Such an analysis helps us understand what processes the client wants to implement and how those processes will act in a decentralized environment. This is an essential step that directly influences which blockchain platform would be best to use.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background wp-block-heading\"><strong>See how Blaize team provides business analysis for our clients while <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-to-build-a-successful-defi-project\/#Business-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developing a DeFi project<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to a thorough analysis during the discovery stage, our specialists can validate the business idea, define the right tokenomics, and turn your project into a beneficial business case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Establish the type of your decentralized project<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before answering the questions like how to choose the best dApp platform or the most suitable blockchain network for your decentralized app, we need to take into account a few crucial points.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A thorough business analysis of the existing case and requirements helps us define the future project scope and especially the type of your project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Usually, Blaize specialists define the following types of blockchain-based projects:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\"><em>1.Developing an entire <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/blockchain-ecosystems\/\">blockchain ecosystem<\/a> from scratch&nbsp;<\/em><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first type of blockchain-based solutions relies on the fact that your business processes lay entirely on the blockchain. In this case, you will need to develop your own decentralized solution from the beginning. We have concentrated on this type of development in one of our previous articles on <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-to-choose-a-reliable-blockchain-company-for-your-project\/#BLOCKCHAIN-FROM-SCRATCH\">how to choose a reliable blockchain company<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">2.Create a bridge or a 2-layer solution<\/span><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of project is applicable when the blockchain is already chosen and there is a need to build a 2-layer solution for it (for example, a rollup like Metis, or a sub-chain like the ones in the Avalanche ecosystem). In this case, your business has to rely entirely on the blockchain as well.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read Also: If you&#8217;re keen to delve deeper into 2-layer solutions, don&#8217;t miss our <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/overview\/a-comprehensive-guide-on-blockchain-layer-2-scaling-solutions\/\">comprehensive guide on how to build a layer 2 blockchain<\/a><\/strong>.

We expect a high demand for this type of solution along with <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021\/\">Polkadot<\/a> and Cosmos SDK wider adoption.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">3.Empowering your current solution with blockchain&nbsp;<\/span><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third type of our development approach concentrates on the adoption of any crypto payment system to your current solution. This might be done by either integrating an existing blockchain to a client\u2019s solution or <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/which-blockchain-to-fork-to-start-your-own-cryptocurrency\/\">forking a chosen crypto currency<\/a> and adapting it to the customer\u2019s requirements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">See how Blaize performed such development in the <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/clients\/remme\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Remme use case<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Though there are situations when your project does not require any on-chain development but still needs smart contracts. In such a case, it is much better to create your own network based on a ready-made solution (for example, fork a Parity node) and implement some additional necessary features.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main challenges here is the correct adaptation and adjustment of the existing solutions to the client\u2019s needs since forking a chain is not an issue but ensuring smooth work afterward is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><span class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">4.<strong><strong>Developing a decentralized app<\/strong><\/strong><\/span><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We would say that this is an ever-green request \u2013 our team works on the development of new dApps for different businesses all the time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This case is applicable if your company\u2019s processes need to be somehow connected to the blockchain. Any of the existing dApps (e.g. Uniswap, MetaMask, OpenSea) can be used as an example of such an approach.

Plenty. But in terms of dApp development, we consider Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Aptos, SuiChain, and StarkNet as the most popular blockchain platforms for dApps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1031\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/article-1.jpg\" alt=\"Top blockchain platforms for dApp development\" class=\"wp-image-28715\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/article-1.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/article-1-1536x990.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/article-1-1568x1010.jpg 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><figcaption><em>Comparison of the 6 best blockchains for dApps<br>(as of Jan 12, 2023)<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to their wide lists of functionalities and unique possibilities Blaize experts establish them as the best blockchain platforms for developing a decentralized application.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s go through their main characteristics and define pros and cons of each.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Ethereum-network\"><strong>Ethereum network&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This platform is one of the pioneers on the market and a popular choice while selecting a blockchain platform for project development.

It has a large toolset, a lot of liquidity, and plenty of ready-made solutions that can help you build your product easier and quickly.

Uniswap, Compound, Synthetix, Maker, Curve, AAVE, etc. are hosted within the Ethereum network.
