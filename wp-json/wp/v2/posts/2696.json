It caused the main problem of today&#8217;s blockchain ecosystems &#8211; lack of interoperability between different protocols. Moreover, for sufficient and scalable work, blockchains need constant upgrades and enhancement. This process goes much slower than in the case of app or browser updates and usually requires network forks. Such difficulties created a \u201ccommunication\u201d problem in terms of blockchains cooperation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The solution&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Polkadot resolves this problem by enabling different blockchain \u201cwork\u201d together in a more efficient way. It allows forkless updates which considerably enhance throughput and scalability. Apart from blockchains, it also connects oracles, permissioned and consortium chains. All of it is available via Polkadot relay chain, which is transparent and highly secured.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main advantages of the relay chain is the ability to exchange data between different chains and ecosystems without any drastic system changes, updates or hard forks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About tech background&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Polkadot is a blockchain which is created within the <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Substrate<\/a> framework.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>Read more about Substrate specific features in our article<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development\/\" target=\"_blank\"> Best Platform for Blockchain Development<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Substrate has a huge kit of tools that enable <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/decentralized-application\/\">dapp development<\/a> of any size and kind. Such a wide spectrum of possibilities allows for advanced and complex blockchain building.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of its release, Polkadot blockchain was the first and the main Substrate project. Apart from Polkadot, Substrate framework is a home for many other dapps and blockchains which can be easily integrated with Polkadot due to a similar ecosystem environment. Therefore, we can say that Polkadot is a platform for Substrate based <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/top-successful-defi-startups\/\">blockchain DeFi startups<\/a> in particular.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Polkadot provides bridges for not-integrated chains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this moment Polkadot is in the phase of mainnet release. So, it still has disabled parachain slots. On the other hand, Web3 Foundation enabled Polkadot \u201clittle\u201d brother Kusama to take advantage of the projects&#8217; kick offs.&nbsp;Read: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/what-to-expect-blaize-predictions-of-blockchain-development-trends-in-2021\/\">Blockchain Technology Trends<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KUSAMA\">Kusama<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kusama is, as its website says, a Polkadot \u201ccousin\u201d and is built on Substrate as well. It was created by the co-founder of Polkadot and utilizes approximately the same codebase.&nbsp;Therefore, it can rightfully be considered one of the top Polkadot projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main aim of Kusama is to create an environment pleasant to test innovative or fast-building projects, as well as to make the pre-check before deploying startups on Polkadot. It is important to distinguish that this is not a test-chain, this is the place for experiments and test development checking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a successful test, It is not necessary to move your project to Polkadot. You can stay exclusively with Kusama, as long as it is a completely independent parachain project owned and governed by the KSM token holders.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of KSM tokens, holders can validate transactions or name validators, link parachains, pay for transactions or vote on common matters. Interestingly, in case of buying DOT (Polkadot tokens), the holder may expect the same share in the Kusama ecosystem.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to start ?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to fulfill a test, a project should register a Kusama account. It is permissionless and accessible for everyone.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong><em>Thinking of bringing life to a <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/for-startups\/\">new startup<\/a><\/em><\/strong> <strong><em>or project on Polkadot? <a href=\"#post_contact\">Blaize experts <\/a>are here to help with your initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a Polkadot project, Kusama requires a very little KSM amount in order to get in and connect your project in comparison with its named \u201ccousin\u201d. The same &#8211; meaning lower &#8211; fees are applied to validation and staking processes as well. This is one of the advantages new-born Polakdot projects should be happy about.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exact amount you should pay is calculated according to <a href=\"https:\/\/guide.kusama.network\/docs\/en\/learn-phragmen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Phragmen\u2019s method<\/a>. Phragmen\u2019s method helps to select the most \u201csuitable\u201d validator in two steps. The first one is to pick a certain (<em>x<\/em>) amount of users based on the votes\u2019 stake-weight. Then it strives to equalize the variance of the stake for each validator.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user can get KSM in two ways. The first one is to claim DOT token and get the proportional amount of Kusama tokens. the user claims Kusama tokens with the help of MyCrypto app.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"980\" height=\"405\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/07IjPZ_-Wcf-lI4NH.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-33151\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>MyCrypto Kusama tokens claim<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After confirming the claim, KSM tokens will be transferred to the account the user specified.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second way is to buy KSM on one of the existing exchanges, for instance Bitfinex, Binance or Kraken.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>According to this all, Kasuma becomes a very much-needed platform for young startups or other innovative projects on Polkadot.

In order to enable its usage while staked, Acala introduces the Homa Protocol. With its help, the user stakes the DOT and receives (liquid DOT) L-DOTs as a derivative in return. L-DOTs holders are able to participate in the validation system the same as regular DOTs holders. Additionally, the team is currently working on unlocking the ability to participate in Polkadot on-chain governing for Liquid DOT owners.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>Homa liquidity protocol makes a true revolution because it enables earning from token staking, while not limiting its utilization within the network.

This is possible due to the emission of fungible DROP and TIN tokens which the user gets while providing liquidity to the pool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, all Tinlake pools are independent and one user can create multiple pools. For instance, one pool for invoices and one for loans or mortgages. In case of creation many pools, risks and liquidity providing earnings are shared within one pool, not for all pools the user has.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>Summarizing, Tinlake is very useful and valuable for both: investors and borrowers so-called originators.

It will allow smart contract creation within the ecosystem. Its smart contracts are written in Rust and compiled into WASM &#8211; a very convenient technique for Substrate based blockchains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within Edgware users are able to perform voting and funding processes as well as delegate their rights due to nPoS &#8211; nominated Proof of Stake &#8211; consensus. One of the main goals of the network was (and still remain) to build a pleasant test environment for on-chain governance. Hence, Edgeware is built so that the system implements self-improvements and then asks participants to vote on them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read More: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/analysis\/how-to-launch-an-ico-sto-or-ieo-in-2023-benefits-tips-best-practices\/\">How to Launch an ICO, STO, or IEO<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s new?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1234\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Blaze-05102020_2.png\" alt=\"Edgeware project on polkadot stack system Parity Substrate\n\" class=\"wp-image-2722\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Edgeware Stack <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Edgeware ecosystem is able to provide on-going self-improvement without system stoppage and any drastic changes. This is possible thanks to the Substrate base which network uses. Due to the blockchain modularity Edgeware offers, different blockchain parts are separated from each other in modules so that the one performs changes to a single part, not the whole system. This allows for quick and on-chain improvements while having just a part of a new code in a hand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to spread its tokens (EDG), the Edgeware network used a first of its kind lockdrop method. According to it, in order to join, a participant has to lock up his ETH and then get EDG in return. As soon as ETHs are locked in a smart contract, a participant gets a proportional number of EDG according to the ETH amount and a lockdrop duration time. There are three time slots: 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. After the expiry date, the whole amount of ETHs goes back to its owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>Edgeware is a cutting edge solution in terms of instant self-improvement and highly speeded smart contract execution and system updates.
