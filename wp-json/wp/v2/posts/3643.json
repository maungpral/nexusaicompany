The main complaints and inconveniences were mainly due to slow transaction operation speed and the issue of scalability in general.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very new and thorough idea of Ethereum evolution &#8211; Serenity &#8211; was presented on the Devcon4 by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Km9BaxRm1wA&amp;t=1272s&amp;ab_channel=betterdot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vitalik Buterin in 2018<\/a>. The Serenity adoption is planned for a gradual system\u2019s update according to the following phases:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Phase 0 &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/beaconcha.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Beacon Chain<\/a> adoption and integration of new Ethereum PoS (launched on the 1st Dec 2020);<\/li><li>Phase 1 &#8211; will see the integration of PoS and shard chains (expected on the Q4 of 2021);<\/li><li>Phase 1.5 &#8211; represents the full transition of Ethereum 1.0 to the Beacon chain as one of the shards (expected 2022);<\/li><li>Phase 2 &#8211; will bring the whole Ethereum 2.0 functionality together and show smart contract execution by the very new eWASM (Ethereum-flavored Web Assembly) to the world (expected 2023).&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The world has never seen a transition of such a big ecosystem therefore the occurrence of numerous doubts and uncertainties is quite normal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the biggest worries we can highlight the fact that Ethereum has never followed strict deadlines and the scalability of such an initiative gives this event additional complexity. Yet, worth noting, that the release of other shard-based blockchain guided by PoS consensus like <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-to-choose-the-right-blockchain-network-for-your-dapp-development\/#NEAR-BLOCKCHAIN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Near<\/a> gives the initiative additional scores to win.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum switch to the PoS consensus was frequently underlined as one of the main system\u2019s updates. Along with the future implementation of sharding, this will significantly improve network operability speed and increase transactions\u2019 throughput. That is why Ethereum transition will deservedly become one of the biggest blockchain trends in 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Predictions of Blockchain Technology in DeFi&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized finance TVL (total value locked) in 13.84B is beating its own record every week since the Q3 of the passing year.

However, the occurrence of numerous recent issues regarding <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/defi-security-how-to-prevent-your-defi-project-from-hacking\/\">DeFi security<\/a> has a real intensity to influence further elaboration.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>DeFi Vampire Attacks&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The open-source nature is the solid fundament of the whole web3.

Different DeFi integration is the other important step in improving protocol reliability.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blockchain technology trend will continue in 2021 and moreover, DeFi\u2019s integration will overgrow protocols\u2019 merger.
