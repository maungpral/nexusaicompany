The platform connects lenders with borrowers through the application interface and allows for a number of advantages for both sides of the deal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of blockchain technology, peer-to-peer lending using blockchain can be implemented, which adds a higher level of transparency and security to the lending process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, it offers better interest rates for lenders and more flexible time frames along with lower return rates for borrowers. However, despite the numerous pros and privileges the system offers, the p2p loans are often called unsecured loans due to the lack of collateral, enough level of transparency and tracking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This is where blockchain can help.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The introduction of blockchain to the current p2p lending solution may turn to the list of benefits.&nbsp;<strong><em>Blockchain peer to peer lending help to resolve the following issues:&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"750\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/creating-Blockchain-P2P-lending-platform.png\" alt=\"creating Blockchain P2P lending platform\" class=\"wp-image-7522\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">Automation\u00a0<\/span><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Since a majority of p2p lending services are centralized, the application management along with the whole loan transfer process is held by the platform. In blockchain p2p lending, the main job will be held by a smart contract that avoids a middleman involvement and leads to a higher level of program automation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">Immutability\u00a0<\/span><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology ensures versatility and immutability of data. The main advantage of this feature is that once the information is provided to the system it cannot be changed or deleted. This can significantly increase the level of security for peer-to-peer lending users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-primary-red-color\">Transparency\u00a0<\/span><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The distributed ledger technology used in the sense of data storing is able to create transparency and decentralization within a trustless environment. Thus, adding blockchain technology to your current p2p lending service may lead to easier data tracking and the highest level of transparency.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"HOW-TO-ADD-BLOCKCHAIN-TO-YOUR-CURRENT-P2P-LENDING-SOLUTION\">How to add blockchain to your current p2p lending solution<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this part we would like to tell you how to secure a lending platform with the <a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/blockchain-integration\/\">integration of blockchain<\/a> based solutions.

In a peer-to-peer lending blockchain platform, a p2p lending smart contract can automate the lending process, execute payments and enforce repayment terms. <strong>We recommend storing as little as possible on-chain, but all stored data should be available for validation.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/blaize.tech\/article-type\/how-to-launch-a-project-on-polkadot-dapp-parachain-and-bridge\/\">How to launch a project on Polkadot<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since all data is stored on-chain and is easily validated, the process of collecting debts by collectors (as well as bargaining in overdue debts) becomes more convenient. On the other hand, <strong>the biggest challenge is to configure this process with KYC to prevent leakage of private and sensible client data <\/strong>as blockchain (in most cases) provides public access to all on-chain information.

The other distinctive feature of DeFi lending is the necessity of providing the collateral in a form of other cryptocurrencies offered against the loan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, ETH (or Bitcoin) is used as a secured form of collateral, yet many platforms also use DAI as sufficient insurance. The majority of lendings in decentralized finance establish a very high loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, even up to 60% which means the borrower will get less than 60% of needed crypto in comparison to the collateral provided.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the principle of decentralization, anonymity, and the possibility of getting a loan in a trice is the advantage that distinguishes DeFi lending pools. Additionally, this type of lending creates very convenient opportunities for borrowers who like to take part in margin trading.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The instantaneous growth of DeFi has attracted an impressive amount of liquidity that helped some protocols gain an absolute market priority.
