										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You probably have an idea of your future blockchain project and are currently searching for a reliable blockchain development company to hire. Bingo! You are at the right web page. We have compiled below a list of the top 5 blockchain development companies that you can research and contact for a consultation. Hope it will help you!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Choose the Right Blockchain Development Company</h2>



<p>These will help you choose a partner that&#8217;s qualified, reliable, and well-matched to your specific project.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Industry Experience</h3>



<p>For example, an organisation that has fintech and DeFi projects under its belt will have an understanding of financial regulations and security (which is critical for banking apps). One with supply chain experience will know how to use blockchain for provenance and logistics. Domain-specific knowledge can accelerate development and avoid industry-specific pitfalls.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tech Stack &amp; Platforms Supported</h3>



<p>Blockchain technology is not one-size-fits-all. Evaluate which blockchain platforms and technologies the firm specializes in. Top developers are typically knowledgeable in Ethereum and Solidity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Security &amp; Compliance Track Record</h3>



<p>Consider compliance if your project is touching regulated areas – e.g., KYC/AML in crypto finance or sensitive medical data. A decent developer should be aware of relevant laws and standards (GDPR, financial regulations, etc.) and develop solutions with compliance in mind.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Proven Portfolio &amp; Case Studies</h3>



<p>A good portfolio demonstrates experience solving real problems. Don&#8217;t just count projects. Review their outcomes (e.g. user base, performance, security post-deployment). If possible, request references or speak with past clients about their experience. A company that can demonstrate tangible results in your target industry will be one that will require less of a learning curve to effectively deliver your project.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Client Testimonials &amp; Ratings</h3>



<p>Browse review information for strengths and weaknesses comments. Do clients rave about their communication, project management, and technical expertise? Any red flags mentioned repeatedly? Testimonials on the company&#8217;s site can be useful too, though third-party sites are less biased. Awards or recognition (e.g. &#8220;Top Blockchain Developer on Clutch 2025&#8221;) also build credibility. In short, prefer companies with excellent client reviews and a solid reputation in the industry.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Capacity to Provide Strategic Consultation Advice</h3>



<p>Finally, the leading blockchain development partners are more than just code writers – they are also strategic advisors. Especially if you&#8217;re new to blockchain, you&#8217;ll value a team that will help you refine your concept, choose the right blockchain protocol or architecture, and design for scalability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The year 2024 promises to be a revolutionary for web3 adoption: account abstraction becomes a true trend. This concept transcends the limitations of externally owned accounts (EOAs) by introducing programmable smart contracts as wallets, unlocking a new era of enhanced security, flexibility, and user-centricity. Understanding its implications and embracing early adoption are crucial steps for protocols seeking to thrive in this rapidly evolving landscape.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="747" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction.webp" alt="Account abstraction becomes a true trend of the year 2024." class="wp-image-54060" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-1536x717.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-1568x732.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>To understand the importance of account abstraction in the year 2024, let’s answer together one simple question: how many steps are obligatory to be completed to buy or sell ETH? You may be surprised, but <strong>there are at least an astonishing 17 steps! </strong>For instance, signing up to Facebook takes you just 4 simple steps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Step</strong></td><td><strong>Buy-Sell ETH Process</strong></td><td><strong>Facebook Sign Up Process</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Choose a wallet.</td><td>Go to <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook.com</a> and click Create New Account.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Save the keystore file.</td><td>Enter your name, email or mobile phone number, password, date of birth and gender.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Save your private key and keep it safe.</td><td>Click Sign Up.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Open your wallet.</td><td>To finish creating your account, you need to confirm your email or mobile phone number.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Copy your wallet address.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Choose an exchange.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Register.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Set up two-factor authentication.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Verify your account.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Upload your ID.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Deposit.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Buy ETH.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Confirm.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Send ETH to your wallet.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Input your gas price.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Submit the transaction.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Continue to hit refresh on Etherscan until the transaction is confirmed.</td><td>&#8211;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The difference and the gap between these two processes are just impressive and account abstraction is a technology struggling to eliminate this gap.</p>



<p>So, the account abstraction is a game-changer solution that potentially might drive web3 adoption drastically.</p>



<p>Prominent scaling solutions like zkSync and Starknet have preemptively integrated account abstraction, recognizing its profound impact. Additionally, Vitalik Buterin is a strong advocate of this solution. This confluence of factors, coupled with the overall web3 trend towards improved user experience, paints a clear picture: <strong>account abstraction is not just an option, it&#8217;s a necessity for future-proof protocols</strong>. And, surely, that’s not it!</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoRank_io">Cryptorank</a>, more than 60 major web3 projects implemented account abstraction technology:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="1169" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-ethereum.webp" alt="As of year 2024 More than 60 major web3 projects implemented account abstraction technology." class="wp-image-54061" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-ethereum.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-ethereum-1536x1122.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-ethereum-1568x1146.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>While implementing account abstraction may require an initial investment, the long-term benefits are irrefutable. Transactions become significantly faster, more secure, and highly customizable. Imagine multi-signature wallets, social recovery options, and even dApp-specific controls seamlessly integrated within the wallet itself. This efficiency boost translates to a superior user experience, attracting and retaining valuable users within your protocol.</p>



<p>This comprehensive guide dives deeper into the intricate details of account abstraction, illuminating its impact on both protocols and users. We will explore the technical aspects of ERC-4337, showcase practical use cases, and equip you with invaluable insights to navigate this transformative shift with confidence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Account Abstraction and Why is it Needed?</h2>



<p>The current blockchain account model, dominated by EOAs, faces an inherent paradox: prioritizing simplicity at the expense of user experience. While the benefit of a single private key for control lies in its simplicity, it suffers from limitations that hinder mainstream adoption and innovative dApp development. Enter account abstraction, a paradigm shift promising to bridge this gap by introducing programmable smart contracts as wallets.</p>



<p>Imagine interacting with the blockchain not through static key pairs, but with dynamic, customizable smart contracts. This is the essence of account abstraction. It decouples the underlying account logic from the blockchain layer, empowering users with a new level of control and flexibility. But why is this change necessary?</p>



<p><strong>Current limitations of EOAs are:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Security</strong>: Single private keys are susceptible to theft, phishing, and user error. Account abstraction allows for multi-signature wallets, social recovery mechanisms, and granular access control, significantly enhancing security.</li>



<li><strong>Inefficient Transactions</strong>: Every transaction requires the same key signature process, hindering scalability. Account abstraction enables fee delegation, gasless transactions, and batched operations, improving transaction efficiency.</li>



<li><strong>Lack of Customization</strong>: EOAs offer minimal flexibility. With account abstraction, wallets can be tailored to specific use cases, integrating features like spending limits, time-locked transactions, and dApp-specific controls.</li>
</ul>



<p>By addressing these shortcomings, account abstraction paves the way for a frictionless user experience, increased security, and a flourishing dApp ecosystem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Current State of Accounts in Blockchains</strong></h3>



<p>Traditionally, blockchain accounts, particularly in Ethereum, are categorized into two main types: EOAs and contract accounts. EOAs are controlled by private keys, and contract accounts are governed by their contract code. This division, while functional, introduces limitations in security, customizability, and scalability. EOAs face security risks due to the reliance on private keys, which, if compromised, can lead to loss of assets. Furthermore, the binary nature of account types restricts the development of more nuanced and user-specific functionalities.</p>



<p>The foundation of understanding account abstraction lies in acknowledging the limitations of its predecessor, the EOA. EOAs offer simplicity, but at the cost of:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unrecoverable Funds:</strong> Lost private keys result in lost funds, a major stumbling block for mainstream adoption.</li>



<li><strong>Inflexible Transactions:</strong> Every transaction requires the same signature process, regardless of complexity.</li>



<li><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/web3-security/9-most-common-smart-contract-vulnerabilities-found-by-blaize/"><strong>Limited Security</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Single points of failure through private keys expose accounts to theft and phishing attacks.</li>



<li><strong>Inefficient Scalability:</strong> As network usage increases, the EOA model struggles to keep up, leading to congestion and high transaction fees.</li>
</ul>



<p>While advancements like contract-based accounts (CBAs) and hierarchical deterministic wallets (HD wallets) offer some improvements, they remain limited in scope and functionality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Account Abstraction Improves User Experience</strong></h3>



<p>Account abstraction proposes a unified model that blends the flexibility of contract accounts with the direct control of EOAs, thereby enhancing the blockchain user experience. Through mechanisms like signature abstraction and fee abstraction, account abstraction enables more user-friendly blockchain applications. Users can interact with smart contracts as seamlessly as with traditional accounts, without worrying about the complexities of gas payments and transaction signatures. This shift not only simplifies the user experience but also opens up new possibilities for application developers.</p>



<p>Account abstraction transcends these limitations by introducing an additional layer over the blockchain, which delegates most of actions to smart contracts. This unlocks a range of features that significantly enhance user experience:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Signature Abstraction:</strong> Users no longer need to manually sign transactions with private keys. Instead, smart contracts handle the signing logic, eliminating the risk of user error and phishing attacks.</li>



<li><strong>Fee Abstraction:</strong> Transaction fees can be dynamically managed through smart contracts, enabling features like fee delegation and gasless transactions for specific use cases.</li>



<li><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/web3-security/how-to-boost-smart-contract-security-and-mitigate-risks-in-defi/"><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Multi-signature wallets, social recovery mechanisms, and custom access controls can be implemented within the smart contract, mitigating single points of failure and theft risks.</li>



<li><strong>Customizable Transactions:</strong> Smart contracts can be programmed to include spending limits, time-locked transactions, and dApp-specific controls, tailoring the user experience to specific needs.</li>
</ul>



<p>These features translate to a seamless and secure interaction with the blockchain. From simplified transactions to robust security measures, account abstraction empowers users and fosters a more vibrant dApp ecosystem.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Concept of Account Abstraction</h2>



<p>Account abstraction represents a great step forward in how users interact with blockchains. Instead of the old method where accounts are just linked to keys (EOAs), this new approach separates the account&#8217;s operations by introducing a paradigm of decoupling, where account logic resides in programmable smart contracts. Let’s take a closer look at its core principles together.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Decoupling Address and Private Key</strong></h3>



<p>Traditionally, blockchain accounts function as a singular entity, where the address serves as a representation of ownership and the private key grants access and authorizes transactions. Account abstraction disrupts this tight coupling by introducing a crucial separation. The account address remains the public face, representing ownership of assets, while the private key (or any other signing mechanism) becomes decoupled and resides within the smart contract governing the account.</p>



<p>This fundamental separation unlocks plenty of benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility and Customization:</strong> Smart contracts become programmable wallets, allowing for tailored functionalities like spending limits, transaction approvals by specific parties, and integration with dApps.</li>



<li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Complex signing processes get abstracted away, replaced by user-friendly interfaces within the smart contract, improving overall usability.</li>



<li><strong>Higher Reliability:</strong> The private key no longer directly exposes the account, mitigating theft and phishing risks. Multi-signature, time-locked, and other advanced authorization mechanisms can be implemented within the smart contract, significantly elevating security.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transitioning from Simple Accounts to Programmable Ones</strong></h3>



<p>Imagine the evolution from a basic calculator to a fully programmable computer. Account abstraction follows a similar trajectory, transforming static EOAs into <strong>dynamic and feature-rich</strong> smart contract accounts (SCAs). Let&#8217;s trace this transformation:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>EOAs:</strong> Limited to basic functions like sending and receiving tokens, governed solely by private keys.</li>



<li><strong>CBAs (Contract-Based Accounts):</strong> Introduced a layer of complexity with smart contracts controlling account logic, but still lacked flexibility and advanced features.</li>



<li><strong>HD Wallets:</strong> Offered improved key management with deterministic generation and hierarchical structures, but remained limited in functionality.</li>



<li><strong>SCAs (Smart Contract Accounts with Account Abstraction):</strong> Represent the pinnacle of this evolution, empowering accounts with:</li>
</ul>



<ol>
<li>Transactions, signing processes, and access control tailored to specific needs.</li>



<li>Multi-signature, social recovery, and advanced authorization mechanisms built into the contract.</li>



<li>Ability to interact seamlessly with dApps and DeFi protocols.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smart Wallets and Their Capabilities</strong></h3>



<p>Account abstraction unlocks a new era of account management with smart contract wallets (SCWs). Imagine EOAs evolving from simple calculators to full-fledged computers, capable of complex calculations and tailored functionalities. SCWs embody this transformation, empowering users with an unprecedented level of control and flexibility.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore the capabilities that differentiate SCWs from their basic counterparts:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Logic and Rules:</strong> Unlike the rigid structure of EOAs, SCWs can be programmed with specific logic and rules governing their operation. Imagine setting spending limits, requiring multiple approvals for transactions, or integrating with specific dApps seamlessly. This customizability opens doors for a wide range of use cases.</li>



<li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> Single points of failure like private keys become relics of the past. SCWs can implement multi-signature wallets, social recovery mechanisms, and time-locked transactions, significantly bolstering security and mitigating theft risks.</li>



<li><strong>Advanced Authorization:</strong> Go beyond simple key-based approvals. SCWs allow for granular access control, specifying who can initiate transactions, under what conditions, and with what limits. This fine-grained control empowers users and safeguards their assets.</li>



<li><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/ethereum-based-dapp-development-for-trading-platform/"><strong>DApp Integration</strong></a><strong>:</strong> SCWs aren&#8217;t isolated entities. They can be programmed to interact seamlessly with various dApps and DeFi protocols, eliminating the need for multiple accounts and cumbersome manual processes. This fosters a more cohesive and user-friendly experience.</li>



<li><strong>Evolving Capabilities:</strong> The beauty of SCWs lies in their inherent upgradability. New features and functionalities can be added over time, ensuring your wallet remains adaptive and future-proof. This continuous evolution unlocks a world of possibilities for developers and users alike.</li>
</ul>



<p>These capabilities paint a picture of <strong>dynamic and intelligent wallets</strong>, far exceeding the limitations of traditional EOAs. Imagine a self-custodial wallet with time-locked withdrawals for impulse control, a multi-signature DAO treasury requiring majority approval for spending, or a dApp-specific wallet pre-configured for seamless interaction within a particular ecosystem. The possibilities are truly endless.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Account Abstraction in Ethereum</h2>



<p>While the concept of account abstraction holds immense potential, its practical implementation requires specific technical considerations. In the Ethereum ecosystem, the ERC-4337 standard stands as the driving force, enabling this paradigm shift without requiring fundamental changes to the underlying protocol. Let&#8217;s delve into the specifics of this implementation and dissect the key components powering account abstraction in Ethereum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview of ERC-4337 Standard</h2>



<p>Unlike typical Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which often propose modifications to the core protocol, ERC-4337 takes a different approach. It introduces an additional layer, essentially building upon the existing blockchain layer without requiring consensus-level changes. This ingenious approach offers several advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Faster Adoption:</strong> No need for network-wide upgrades, allowing protocols and users to embrace account abstraction at their own pace.</li>

<li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Existing tools and infrastructure remain compatible, minimizing disruption and easing the transition for developers and users.</li>
</ul>



<p>Therefore, ERC-4337 acts as a <strong>bridge between EOAs and smart contract accounts</strong>, facilitating the adoption of this transformative technology.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="840" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eth-account-abstraction.webp" alt="ERC-4337 introduces a layer-two solution, essentially building upon the existing blockchain layer without requiring consensus-level changes." class="wp-image-54062" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eth-account-abstraction.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eth-account-abstraction-1536x806.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eth-account-abstraction-1568x823.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s dissect the fundamental elements that make ERC-4337 great:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>UserOperations:</strong> These represent the core building blocks of interaction, encapsulating all transaction data, signatures, and other relevant information. They act as intermediaries between users and the blockchain, decoupling them from the complexities of key management and authorization.</li>



<li><strong>EntryPoint Contract:</strong> This smart contract serves as the central hub, validating UserOperations and relaying them to the Ethereum network. It acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring compliance with protocol rules and preventing invalid transactions.</li>



<li><strong>Paymasters:</strong> These optional entities handle transaction fees, offering flexibility and innovative possibilities. Paymasters can cover gas costs for users, sponsor specific transactions, or implement custom fee models, opening doors for novel use cases.</li>
</ul>



<p>With these core components working in concert, ERC-4337 successfully abstracts away the complexities of account management, empowering users with enhanced security, flexibility, and a superior user experience.</p>



<p>Understanding the flow of a transaction within the ERC-4337 framework sheds light on its security and reliability:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>User creates a UserOperation:</strong> This transaction data is signed using their preferred method, potentially involving multi-signature wallets or other advanced authorization mechanisms.</li>



<li><strong>UserOperation submitted to EntryPoint:</strong> The user submits the signed UserOperation to the EntryPoint contract.</li>



<li><strong>EntryPoint validates and relays:</strong> The EntryPoint verifies the signatures, ensures compliance with rules, and relays the transaction to the Ethereum network.</li>



<li><strong>Paymaster (optional):</strong> If a paymaster is involved, it handles gas fees or performs additional logic before the transaction is finalized.</li>



<li><strong>Ethereum network processes:</strong> The Ethereum network processes the transaction based on the relayed information.</li>
</ol>



<p>This multi-layered validation flow ensures the integrity and security of transactions while offering the flexibility and benefits of account abstraction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Future of Account Abstraction in Ethereum</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Choose The Right Blockchain Technology Company</h2>



<p>If you are choosing between several blockchain software development companies and having a tough time, take a step back, relax, and try to make things a bit more clear for yourself. This is especially crucial if you have never outsourced the development process to a third party.</p>



<p>So, first of all, what you’d wanna do is create a list of the fundamental details of your project. It should include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>the main idea of your project</li>



<li>the problem your project solves</li>



<li>Its competitive advantages – why it is better than other existing solutions&nbsp;</li>



<li>any suggestions for the preferable concept and blockchain frameworks</li>
</ul>



<p>We recommend clarifying all this information before scheduling calls with potential contractors and even before doing research. This way, you will not waste your time and will get right to what you’re looking for.</p>



<p>If you have no idea about blockchain frameworks to be used, think through the functionality of your project and any future collaborations. This information should be enough for professional companies developing blockchain solutions to recommend you the required tech stack.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">Next, you have two options: to create a blockchain solution from scratch or fork one of the existing chains.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The recent year has come with a lot of way out technologies. Drastic market changes along with worldwide pandemic opened up many new niches and have boosted the development of alternative technologies. Numerous tech approaches and upcoming blockchain solutions give ground for the future suggestions of blockchain trends in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this review, we will analyze the significant events on the crypto market and tell how this will affect the blockchain development industry. We will also share some predictions about blockchain technology for 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Promising Blockchains&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The upcoming 2021 is bringing two huge and very notable players in the blockchain environment. The cross-chain ecosystem of Polkadot along with renewed scalable and powerful Ethereum will surely make an industry turnover.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot parachains revealing</strong></h2>



<p>With the aim of creating the most scalable and interoperable cross-chain environment, Polkadot is one of the leading market changers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Polkadot is a sharded blockchain, meaning it connects several chains together in a single network, allowing them to process transactions in parallel and exchange data between chains with security guarantees”.</em></p><cite><a href="https://polkadot.network/Polkadot-lightpaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Polkadot Litepaper</strong></a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In order to connect or build your own blockchain within this ecosystem, one needs to link to Relay Chain which is a mother blockchain of Polkadot. Until now, the process of connecting the first 5 parachains slots is in a very active development stage.  Those few are the small part out of 100 defined as the primary goal.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><em><span class="has-inline-color has-primary-red-color">Blaize has been sharing reviews on <a href="https://blaize.tech/services/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polkadot ecosystem specification</a> and <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-choose-the-right-blockchain-network-for-your-dapp-development/#POLKADOT-MULTICHAIN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polkadot multichain pros and cons of dApp development</a> in those articles.&nbsp;</span></em></h5>



<p>The biggest number of slots is expected to be added gradually during the next few years. In addition, a significant amount of projects previously deployed to Kusama testnet will start moving to the Polkadot original environment.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="269" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/preview.png" alt="Polkadot blockchain trends in 2021

" class="wp-image-3644"/><figcaption><em>Potential parachains connected to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://polkadot.network/polkadot-parachain-slots/" target="_blank">Polkadot</a>&nbsp;ecosystem</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This alteration will have a great impact on the current market because the overwhelming majority of projects built on the Substrate (for example Social Network, MantraDAO, Acala, Halva, Edgeware, etc.) have the main purpose of ​​joining the Polkadot.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">You can also learn more by contacting our <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/decentralized-application/">dApp development company</a>.</strong></p>



<p>In addition, a lot of DeFi projects are already waiting in the queue (starting with the Chainlink) to launch on the largest blockchain network, which has not had any analogs yet. This may result in a huge DeFi market migration from Ethereum to Polkadot.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em><span class="has-inline-color has-primary-red-color">Read how you can join such a prosperous community and <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-launch-a-project-on-polkadot-dapp-parachain-and-bridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch your project on Polkadot</a>!</span></em></strong></h4>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum 2.0 Transition&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The questions regarding Ethereum enhancement have been circling for a couple of years before. The main complaints and inconveniences were mainly due to slow transaction operation speed and the issue of scalability in general.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The very new and thorough idea of Ethereum evolution &#8211; Serenity &#8211; was presented on the Devcon4 by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km9BaxRm1wA&amp;t=1272s&amp;ab_channel=betterdot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitalik Buterin in 2018</a>. The Serenity adoption is planned for a gradual system’s update according to the following phases:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Phase 0 &#8211; <a href="https://beaconcha.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beacon Chain</a> adoption and integration of new Ethereum PoS (launched on the 1st Dec 2020);</li><li>Phase 1 &#8211; will see the integration of PoS and shard chains (expected on the Q4 of 2021);</li><li>Phase 1.5 &#8211; represents the full transition of Ethereum 1.0 to the Beacon chain as one of the shards (expected 2022);</li><li>Phase 2 &#8211; will bring the whole Ethereum 2.0 functionality together and show smart contract execution by the very new eWASM (Ethereum-flavored Web Assembly) to the world (expected 2023).&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The world has never seen a transition of such a big ecosystem therefore the occurrence of numerous doubts and uncertainties is quite normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of the biggest worries we can highlight the fact that Ethereum has never followed strict deadlines and the scalability of such an initiative gives this event additional complexity. Yet, worth noting, that the release of other shard-based blockchain guided by PoS consensus like <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-choose-the-right-blockchain-network-for-your-dapp-development/#NEAR-BLOCKCHAIN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Near</a> gives the initiative additional scores to win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum switch to the PoS consensus was frequently underlined as one of the main system’s updates. Along with the future implementation of sharding, this will significantly improve network operability speed and increase transactions’ throughput. That is why Ethereum transition will deservedly become one of the biggest blockchain trends in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Predictions of Blockchain Technology in DeFi&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Decentralized finance TVL (total value locked) in 13.84B is beating its own record every week since the Q3 of the passing year. This gives a strong ground to think of the sector&#8217;s future growth and gathering of more power around cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="837" height="426" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/graph.png" alt="blockchain predictions for 2021" class="wp-image-7530"/><figcaption><em>The graph of DeFi TVL, date 23.12.2020</em>, source: <a href="https://defipulse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi Pulse</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The beginning of active development and adoption of advanced financial instruments as <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/top-notch-defi-derivatives-you-should-know-about/">derivatives to decentralized finance</a> also speaks about the future growth of DeFi potential. However, the occurrence of numerous recent issues regarding <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/defi-security-how-to-prevent-your-defi-project-from-hacking/">DeFi security</a> has a real intensity to influence further elaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DeFi Vampire Attacks&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The open-source nature is the solid fundament of the whole web3. Yet, even the best cannot always serve as ideal and the wall has shown the cracks. It appears that the public accessibility the DeFi offers does not always act in goodwill and has resulted in numerous attacks on the protocol securities.</p>



<p>The core concept behind <a href="https://blaize.tech/services/how-to-prevent-liquidity-vampire-attacks-in-defi/">vampire attacks in defi</a> lies in creating the same (or approximately the same) protocol, while adjusting a more profitable and attractive incentive mechanism to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background"><em>We have shared more information and an overview of the biggest vampires in our article on <a href="https://blaize.tech/services/how-to-prevent-liquidity-vampire-attacks-in-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Prevent Liquidity Attack in DeFi</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Some of the prominent and well-known projects like Curve, Compound, and Uniswap have already met their vampires in 2020, yet there are serious reasons to assert the tendency will continue in the upcoming 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The introduction of the underlying protocol token is one of the heal-alls among interactive and user-friendly UI, implementation of DAO, branding strategy, and bug bounty. Different DeFi integration is the other important step in improving protocol reliability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This blockchain technology trend will continue in 2021 and moreover, DeFi’s integration will overgrow protocols’ merger. The incorporation introduced by yEarn shall surely meet the equal competitor, so big hopes for another DeFi realm to be born.&nbsp;Read Also: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-build-a-successful-defi-project/">How to Develop a Successful DeFi Project</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="STABLECOINS"><strong>Stablecoins&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The enormously growing interest in stablecoins cannot remain overlooked as well as its growing TVL as the greatest evidence. As the biggest achievement, we can underline the gradual transition from centralized Tether to crypto-backed Dai.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read also:<a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-create-a-stablecoin-on-ethereum/"> <strong>How to Create a Stablecoin</strong></a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="870" height="533" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blockchain-development-trends.png" alt="blockchain development trends" class="wp-image-7532"/><figcaption><em>Comparison of Dai stablecoin usability in stats</em>, source: <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/makerdaos-year-in-review-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MakerDAO Year review</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>However Dai faces some issues during periods in which it breaks from its peg, Blaize team is very supportive of Dai’s growing power in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The will of keeping assets locked in crypto and turn to<a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/understanding-stablecoin/"> stablecoins</a> underline technology relevance and necessity once again. Therefore, the upcoming year promises to strengthen the stablecoin position on the market, which might contribute to pursuing the introduction of legal regulation regarding this technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Read what has been done until now in the article about </em><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-create-a-stablecoin-on-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stablecoin Adoption in Europe</em></a><em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CEX Against DEX</strong></h2>



<p>2020 was very unkind to CEXes and its drop in March was the turning point. Consequently, many large investment groups have moved to DEXes or at least started to consider them seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, technology development solved the main problem with decentralized order books by an introduction of AMMs with the Uniswap ahead. We consider a huge liquidity migration from centralized exchanges to <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-amm-works-technology-basics/">DEXes</a> as one of the main blockchain predictions of 2021. Such a movement will have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency market, as long as the retail investors will also have the opportunity to influence the market prices.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DeFi summary&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The creation of a decentralized financial market and <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/tokenomics-for-crypto-games-how-to-develop-economy-for-gamefi/">DeFi startups</a> is a great initiative that has a proven potential to stay and develop together with us in the upcoming 2021. However, such a wealthy market certainly attacks many unstable and scam protocols. We expect the gradual downfall of DeFi hype in the future year and therefore survival of the authentic, true projects.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Many factors, and the pandemic, in particular, have had a big impact on today&#8217;s market. First, due to the continuous accumulation of large capitals, the market will be pumped and significantly oversaturated with liquidity. The next factor has resulted in an increased interest in cybersecurity and wireless transactions (primarily in online shopping and banking). It will also drive the growth of demand for decentralized applications that are able to provide a trustless environment.</span></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hence, the big boom for decentralized projects featuring the highest security can be expected as one of the blockchain trends. But it is worth noting that many scam projects that have been successfully settled in DeFi shall take a backseat, leaving the market for the leaders”. </span></i></p>        <div class="qutote-lab_text-author">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blockchain Software Development Trends&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Based on the market research and previously mentioned changes the upcoming year might bring, Blaize&#8217;s team of experts can try to formulate the predictions of blockchain technology trends we are about to witness.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rust&nbsp;language </strong></h2>



<p>Rust is a cutting-edge <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/5-best-programming-languages-for-blockchain-development/">programming language</a> that allows for building advanced algorithms in a more <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-create-and-deploy-a-smart-contract-in-a-secure-way/">secure way</a> with higher performance. It possesses a wide list of unique and very helpful features like a conditional compilation or moves semantics which creates a very developer-friendly environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polkadot Relay Chain is built on Substrate framework with Rust language as well as one of the main Ethereum nodes &#8211; Parity. Therefore, the will of projects to connect to the multichain in the nearest future and further implementation of numerous advantages and protocol enhancements will push the demand for developers with great expertise in Rust programming language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, such a need will not be supported by a single Polkadot release. Other events like Near blockchain release or Chainlink with its developed oracle system for Substrate based projects will influence demand for Rust developers. Check the whole list of teams building on Substrate <a href="https://www.substrate.io/substrate-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vyper&nbsp;language</strong></h2>



<p>Vyper is an alternative language for a smart contract running and is the primary language for yEarn smart contracts. It is hosted by <a href="https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brownie</a> community-driven framework for smart contract development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the unconditional leadership of Solidity, recent yEarn strengthening on the market and becoming one of the biggest DeFi conglomerates might create a real market turnover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of the other DeFis that will wish to join the yEarn union will have to include Vyper to the list of must-known tools and therefore push the technology wider application.&nbsp;Read Also: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-conduct-a-smart-contract-security-audit-of-your-project-and-why-this-is-important/">Smart Contract Audits &amp; How to Conduct Them</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blockchain Adoption on the Regular Basis&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Technology adoption on a regular basis is one of the most promising blockchain trends in 2021. This year prepared a solid fundament for blockchain integration into everyday life activities with the introduction of such projects as Celo or Dharma.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="qutote-lab">

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celo Foundation&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://celo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celo</a> is built with the aim to become a mobile-first blockchain platform. Celo blockchain is hosted by the Celo Foundation whose main aim is to simplify the usage of cryptocurrencies and make blockchain-based payments worldwide accessible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main focus of the Celo Foundation is turned to the developing world. One of the biggest advantages of the Celo blockchain is that the user is able to utilize his phone number as a public key in order to link to the network. Additionally, the system does not require an internet connection which makes it very convenient to use and widely accessible.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dharma dApp</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.dharma.io/">Dharma</a> creates a marketplace for lending and borrowing cryptos. The creation of Dharma app made a big step on the way to the global adoption of new blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Until Dharma, investment opportunities in crypto were available just for a few groups of people with a good knowledge of the technology. Yet, DeFi and crypto investment become easily accessible as soon as you connect the Dharma app to your bank account. The initiative is currently available in the US, but we shall expect worldwide expansion very soon. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thought&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The passing year was quite favorable for the blockchain market and fruitful in terms of newborn initiatives and technologies. This helped to build a strong base for future projects to conquer the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sergey Onyshchenko, Blaize CEO see the identity management in decentralized finance as one of the biggest opportunities for blockchain development in 2021:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Blockchain has a real power to enhance Artificial Intelligence solutions and therefore push the technology further. In this article, we want to tell about the unique possibilities blockchain and AI convergence can offer to empower the B2B environment, with a specific focus on <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/for-enterprises/">blockchain development for enterprise</a></strong>.</p>



<p>AI is a dynamically developing technology that enters new markets every year. For now, it has been successfully adopted in nearly all industries from automation to financial spheres. Along with new solutions appearing on the blockchain market, a number of businesses strive to turn their main focus to its implementation.</p>



<p>Although both technologies AI and Blockchain are not fully explored, the combination of them has already proven it can disrupt the market. Therefore, it is worth considering the convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence in more detail.</p>



<p>In this article, we want to focus on the possibility to enable AI and blockchain adoption in financial markets and show how those technologies can complement each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use case implemented by Blaize engineers might be useful for entrepreneurs who want to empower existing business solutions or investors seeking a new place to insert.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="787" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/building-project.png" alt="building project combining AI and Blockchain" class="wp-image-7578"/></figure></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What blockchain has to offer</h2>



<p>Blockchain contributes to secure and trustless data storing of any kind. Primarily, blockchain was considered as a huge digital ledger for carrying out transparent transactions and distributing data in a decentralized manner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nowadays, the technology has found its broadened application in such fields as ownership and identity verification, digital assets transferring, creation of decentralized finance (DeFi) markets and data security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the development of new features improving blockchains operability, such as new consensus methods, the technology started to be more applicable and adoptable. The statement claiming massive <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/blockchain-adoption-to-contact-center-industry-qubicles-use-case/">adoption of blockchain</a> by huge corporations and the B2B sector in general has found its ground in digits.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="has-dark-gray-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong><em><span class="has-inline-color has-dark-gray-color">According to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/understanding-blockchain-potential/global-blockchain-survey.html" target="_blank">Deloitte Blockchain Global research</a>, 55% of companies are thinking of implementing blockchain into their businesses and mark this as a top-five priority.&nbsp;</span></em></strong></h5>



<p class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color"><strong>Moreover, the percentage of respondents who have already started the adoption process has grown by 16% in comparison to the last year and now is 39%.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Such huge steps towards blockchain integration says the entrepreneurs see the benefits it may bring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A core concept of blockchain and the privilege it can bring concentrates on the immutability and transparency of data along with its safe and faster transmissions. Additionally, any data transfer is immutably stored. This creates a pleasant environment for p2p transactions without intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The list of advantages may be even broaden if you <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-develop-blockchain-based-lending-platform/">develop a project that involves blockchain</a> and AI technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How AI can empower blockchain</h2>



<p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) describes the ability of computers to perform tasks that require human intelligence. This happens due to complex heuristic algorithms that are supposed to replicate the process of human decision making.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such a complex construction allows AI mechanisms to gather more information from a certain environment and therefore learn by itself. This process lies in the core of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Machine Learning</a> and is under constant enhancement and development of new approaches.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>According to Omdia’s&nbsp; </em></strong><a href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/OM000850/AI-Market-Maturity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em><strong>AI Market Maturity research</strong></em></a><strong><em>, the global AI software revenue is going to reach above 100 billion by 2025. Moreover, the market will cover more sectors applying AI technology such as government and security.&nbsp;</em></strong></h5>



<p>ML (as well as other types of AI) is dependent on qualified data provision and constant updates. This is necessary for the reliable and effective work of the system. This is the perfect environment where AI can meet blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens when AI and blockchain intersect?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The convergence of blockchain ai and IoT opens up many new possibilities. Data is critical for AI functioning while blockchain provides a trustless environment for its storing. If applied together, those two can exclude the limitations of each and offer considerably more scalable solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain and AI convergence can make a significant impact on a list of industries. Until now, it has proven its usability and usefulness in the following spheres:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>predictions markets (<a href="https://numer.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Numerai</a>);</li><li>AI marketplaces (<a href="https://singularitynet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SingularityNET</a>);</li><li>IoT and smart cities (<a href="https://fetch.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fetch</a>);</li><li>investment and financial management (<a href="https://peculium.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peculium</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Those are just a few examples of projects using synergy of AI and blockchain together. <strong>Worth noticing that out of the experience and prosperous use cases we watch the tendency where more and more financial projects want to interact with AI technology.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Blaize engineers have successfully integrated AI technology into blockchain based platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of Combining AI and Blockchain&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After a thorough analysis of successful use cases combined along with Blaize engineers’ experience, our <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/for-startups/">blockchain consulting team</a> </strong>can distinguish a list of advantages in case both technologies’ adoption occurs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="316" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/benefits.png" alt="develop a project that involves blockchain and AI technology
" class="wp-image-7580"/><figcaption><em>Blockchain-AI combination benefits </em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Data transmission&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As we know, AI models are fed with huge amounts of data to ensure the proper work of the algorithms. AI technology often has a highly centralized level as long as those data are stored on a single centralized cloud or server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the implementation of blockchain, such storage can become decentralized and transparent as the technology concept. This will also influence data transmission speed and higher module’s operability.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Another advantage of Blockchain and AI convergence. Concentrating big data in one place makes it vulnerable and creates an attractive environment for break open. Therefore, the security of those data becomes a big concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain application in this case will provide data immutability and create a trustworthy place for its storing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Upgradability</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Blockchain technology implies storing (and hashing) data simultaneously at all available (connected) nodes (servers). As a result, constant updating of existing data, which is such a necessity for AI and ML, in particular, becomes smoother and faster.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Verification</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>As long as the whole information is stored on-chain it can be asked for verification any time. Moreover, in terms of private blockchains, the owner may establish a certain amount of people who have access to the data. In this case, there is no possibility of unwanted interventions.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Maintenance</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The blockchain industry is growing double-quick while more and more features and tools appear. Each time there is a need for an update it becomes real painstaking work, which also takes an enormous amount of time of the developers (who maintain it).</p>



<p>Imagine a situation where blockchain uses AI technology to update itself without harming the system and users. Such an opportunity would help significantly reduce the time for networks’ maintenance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Immutable data&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>One of the last but most important benefits of AI and blockchain convergence is immutable data. As far as all data put into the blockchain are transparent and accessible for everyone, it ensures its impartial handling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition blockchain tamper-proof feature limit data changing after it had been provided into the system. Hence, even the owner cannot change the information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is incredibly important in terms of machine learning because a subsequent provision of right and unchanged data may speed up the process of algorithm enhancement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blockchain AI projects: Blaize Use Cases</h2>



<p>It is not enough to know well the technology of blockchain and understand how neural networks behave while building projects combining AI and Blockchain. In order to complete such a scalable work, blockchain engineer needs to have strong DevOps skills and previous experience working with large data sets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See how Blaize developers implemented technology adoption into financial management and AI marketplace spheres in our case description below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investment and financial management [NDA Case]</strong></h2>



<p>Unfortunately, this case is under NDA protection, so we cannot publicize the name and certain specifications of the customer. Yet, this is one of the most prominent recent projects Blaize handled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The client came with the idea to create a <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-choose-the-right-blockchain-network-for-your-dapp-development/">blockchain-based network </a>supported by its own stablecoin. The price of stablecoin had to be established in accordance with the price of 9 chosen precious metals and one extra adjustable number.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>Want to get more insights regarding stablecoins and how they function? <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/understanding-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Find it here</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Blaize engineers defined Substrate as the most convenient blockchain framework for carrying out such a task. We chose Substrate because it is the best blockchain framework for building complicated solutions with difficult and wide logic.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Find out more about Substrate and other frameworks in <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Blockchain Development Platforms</a>.&nbsp;</em></h5>



<p>In contrast to other platforms, Substrate gives developers a broadened scope of possibilities and instruments to use. Due to a variety of tools available on the interface, developers can concentrate on the project architecture and adaptation of new technologies, like AI implementation in this particular example.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where financial management uses AI?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The idea to use artificial intelligence and blockchain modules appears in setting the coin price. In further explanation, the price of nine elements out of ten ought to be stable and established in advance. The price of 10th element should be adjustable and counted by in-built neural network algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/golova-1.png" alt="develop a project that involves blockchain and AI technology convergence" class="wp-image-3337" width="859" height="357"/></figure></div>



<p>This might have helped to build a stable yet at the same time quite flexible coin that establishes an accurate price following the market tendency.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI technology integration difficulties&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Blaize had to integrate a neural network with blockchain to set the coin price.</strong> The main obstacle here lies in picking up an appropriate model as far as there is a variety of “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/basics/ai/" target="_blank">narrow AIs</a>” presented. Blaize developers have chosen <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html" target="_blank">LSTM</a> NN as the most suitable for this case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LSTM, or Long Short-Term Memory, is an AI neural network model architecture applied mostly in the deep machine learning field. Besides carrying out such tasks as handwriting or speech recognition, LSTM is highly sufficient for the detection of anomaly actions in network traffic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although stablecoins are built and aimed to be stable assets in this highly volatile crypto market, it still faces a slight fluctuation. Therefore, LSTM NN algorithm distinguishing those fluctuations was extremely accurate in this case.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The other challenging task was to implement chasing logic on Substrate pallets</strong> and configure the node. To complete this, our programmers had to write a separate pallet for every precious metal in order to manage coin issuing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI marketplaces [Pandora Case]</h2>



<p>Pandora is one of the earlier Blaize use cases. The client came with the aim to create a widely accessible, decentralized and censorship-resistant AI marketplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a thorough analysis and case study of an existing solution, Blaize developers decided to implement the smart contract logic on the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> network. The generic architecture of the project is based on <a href="https://medium.com/pandoraboxchain/prometheus-highly-scalable-byzantine-resistant-two-tier-consensus-5f3b0a52a16b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prometheus consensus</a> which had to be integrated with EVM Solidity contracts support.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI part is represented by <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TensorFlow</a> library which is aimed to help in developing and training ML models.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where AI meets Blockchain&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In the case of Pandora boxchain, <strong>the blockchain part was primarily responsible for providing a reliable environment for a huge data set storing</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="787" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/convergence.png" alt="Blockchain and AI convergence" class="wp-image-7581"/><figcaption><em>Blockchain creates a perfect environment for a large data set storing that are required for AI </em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>For a marketplace creation, blockchain technology can be considered as the best solution, as long as you cannot trust everyone on the internet, but you do not have to. The technology ensures a highly secure environment for any kind of financial or informational transfers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the second main task the blockchain does in Pandora case, we can establish <strong>the data distribution and processing</strong>. As it is mentioned before, blockchain applications to AI solutions may empower it in terms of scalability and data processing speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When storing data in blockchain, it is not concentrated in one place, it is distributed among multiple nodes which are able to process them. This might considerably increase the speed of data refining necessary for a proper work of AI modules, in case enough nodes are connected to the network.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blockchain-AI convergence difficulties&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Building projects combining AI and blockchain makes the project architecture very complex. That is why such cases require high precision of work and experts with broadened experience in both technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The first issue was laying in the contract fees optimization</strong>. The creation of such a decentralized environment for AI computations needs a large amount of off-chain data processing and calculations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This faces difficulties in implementation because Ethereum has a limited amount of calculations per block. Therefore, contracts had to be very well optimized in order to reduce huge fees for users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as the main project aim is a worldwide accessible marketplace, we needed to perform this on public blockchains. Those usually are relatively slower than private ones, and <strong>sending</strong> <strong>large AI data sets within the network</strong> did not make the job faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong><em>See a more specific and technical description of this project in <a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/pandora-boxchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pandora Boxchain use case</a>. If you want to look for other cases of Blaize, find them in our <a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">portfolio</a>.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final thought&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As you see, both artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain have already proven that their joint use can bring a lot of benefits in terms of work optimization and financial profits. Worth noticing that many industries have been actively investing in optimizing existing solutions through the implementation of both technologies, so far.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background"><em><strong>If you think of building a project combining AI and Blockchain or developing decentralized AI on the blockchain framework Blaize experienced engineers are <a href="#post_contact">here to help</a>.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>When thinking of creating a project similar to those we have described above or implementing a new idea of your own, we recommend taking into account the developers&#8217; expertise in both areas and the experience of working with large datasets.</strong></p>



<p>In this article, we have shown use cases of how the combination of AI and blockchain can be used to create predictive algorithms and decentralized marketplace. Yet these are far from all the possibilities of the technology and its potential has not yet been fully revealed. Therefore, we are looking forward to new discoveries and further development of AI and machine learning in particular.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Blockchain technology is getting more and more traction. The market shows that companies want to invest in blockchain solutions development for their business. Hence, choosing a reliable blockchain outsourcing company for the project becomes a challenging task.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with blockchain popularization, a lot of outsourcing companies started to add blockchain development services on the list among other technologies and offer it to clients. Though, learning one additional programming language or applying a new skill is not enough to add blockchain to the list of your competencies.</p>



<p>In this article, we will tell the main points to focus on how to choose the best blockchain development company and <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/for-startups/">startup blockchain development</a></strong> for your next project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where to start?</h2>



<p>If you want to find blockchain developers for your next project and have never dealt with product outsourcing we recommend specifying some fundamental basics of your project before initiation or during the discovery phase. Often, those are answers to the main purpose of your project, regarding:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>the main idea of your project;</li><li>the problem your project solves;</li><li>why it is better from the existing solutions;&nbsp;</li><li>any suggestions for the preferable concept and blockchain frameworks.</li></ul>



<p><strong>To find and hire a real blockchain guru with solid tech skills, we recommend answering those questions even before arranging the first meeting</strong>. If specified by yourself, it will help you to know exactly what you are looking for and narrow the companies’ list.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong><em>Asking yourself what is better: outsource your project to experienced blockchain experts or hire your own in-house team? Find some <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/in-house-vs-outsource-blockchain-dev-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">useful recommendations in this article</a></em></strong></p>



<p>The selection of an accurate development framework is a distinctive and very important part of every blockchain-based project. This primary deals with the project&#8217;s purpose for hiring a blockchain company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to understand which type of blockchain development is the most suitable for implementing your idea, let’s look deeper into the main approaches to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>By the way, have you ever thought about GameFi development? Join the cutting edge of gaming technology and elevate your project to new heights with our </em><strong><em><a href="https://blaize.tech/gamefi-development-company/">GameFi development team</a></em></strong><em>. Don&#8217;t miss out on the opportunity to work with the best in the business and bring your gaming ideas to life. Contact us today to take the first step towards your dream project.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Approaches To Blockchain Project Development&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are two main perspectives we can define in terms of blockchain-based project development. They are crucial while choosing the right blockchain development company because each approach requires a different list of <a href="https://blaize.tech/developer-tools/">developer tools </a>and skills the outsource team should have.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="630" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0D1O8Aj2rDr5Y-gBC.png" alt="approaches to blockchain development in outsourcing blockchain company " class="wp-image-33032"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Using Existing Platform</strong></h2>



<p>The first option is to use one of the existing blockchain systems in order to solve a problem, for example, write a smart contract on Solidity or make a comparison cycle on Hyperledger. In order to fulfill such a project, developers need to know a particular programming language and have experience in implementing similar projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, a developer needs to understand how the platform works, its distinctive features and limitations. There are many nuances which in case of disregard, may lead to the process slowing and higher costs.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Suitable for: small and medium-size tasks which require further integration into already existing projects.&nbsp;</em></strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="BLOCKCHAIN-FROM-SCRATCH"><strong>Blockchain from scratch</strong></h2>



<p>The second approach means creating the entire blockchain roughly from scratch. This type is usually used in case of creating a “wow project”, which brings new ideas or alternative solutions to certain industries. In this case, a developer does not need to have explicit knowledge of new languages, the good command of C++ or Python will be enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite this, the second approach<strong> requires more knowledge and experience in building blockchain logic and architecture</strong>, and this is one of the most important things to pay attention to. Frequently, these types of projects provide a money or assets circulation so one small consensus mistake or false node synchronization might be worth millions.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><em><strong>Suitable for: big and scalable project, or <a href="https://blaize.tech/for-enterprises/">enterprise blockchain</a> that needs a custom development of a unique <a href="https://blaize.tech/blockchain-ecosystems/">blockchain ecosystem</a>.</strong>&nbsp;</em></h5>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">To help you understand which blockchain framework is better for your project, check out our deep analysis of <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Blockchain Development Platforms</a></p>



<p>Specifying your project needs and understanding which approach is a good fit considerably narrows the list of possible future vendors and saves you a lot of time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Basic Criteria To concentrate </h2>



<p>After understanding and writing the core insights of your project you can create a list of vendors to contact and discuss your idea. For that purpose, we prepared a list of what to ask and what to focus on while choosing a blockchain outsourcing company for your project in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read Also: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-blockchain-and-ai-convergence-empowers-your-business/">How Blockchain and AI Convergence Empower Your Business</a></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Look for competency</strong></h2>



<p>It is impossible to read the book “How blockchain works” and get the system as there are a number of nuances that can be understood just after gathering considerable experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Do not hesitate to ask for relevant documentation in order to ensure a company has the required skills and knowledge</strong>.&nbsp;</h5>



<p>One of the best ways to check an IT company activity on the market is to ask for a link to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github</a>, where you will find all the projects description. Pay attention to the Github authors and the project release dates.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="923" height="609" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0G9ebJYcfDwsJROS6.jpg" alt="ask for company github while choosing a blockchain outsourcing company " class="wp-image-33034"/><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://github.com/blaize-tech" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Blaize Github</strong></a>, <a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/snglsdao/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>snglsDAO</strong></a> project description</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can also ask for a call with a team’s engineers directly, in order to clarify any technology uncertainties. <strong>This is your money and you have to know whom you pay it and for what. </strong></p>



<p>For those, who do not want to dive into code and strongly technical descriptions, we recommend checking the <a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/">company’s portfolio</a> on the main website.<strong> </strong>Vendors often put the most scalable and meaningful cases on this list. Therefore, while looking for a company’s portfolio you can additionally check the scale this particular blockchain company deals with. It will also help you find the best blockchain developer for your project.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;<strong>Evaluate team creativity and approach flexibility</strong></h2>



<p>After understanding and writing the core insights of your project idea, send this list to the chosen company. Do this in advance to give them some time to prepare a thorough offer for you. <strong>Ask as many questions as you can to ensure the technical engineers read your requirements and understand every small detail.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the communication process, <strong>evaluate how many solutions are offered to you</strong>. Sometimes <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/opinion/top-10-blockchain-development-companies-for-2023/">blockchain development companies</a> prepare a few options in order to offer a various range of cost estimation, but this is another thing. Despite ensuring blockchain company’s pricing flexibility, try to check for creativity and approach versatility.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="878" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/0JvHCn_NLBgHADF_9.png" alt="looking for custom blockchain development vendor" class="wp-image-33035"/></figure>



<p>To offer flexible approaches means to look for alternative methods of problem-solving at equal price and quality. This feature will be an advantage while dealing with big and scalable projects and become a huge plus in case of implementing a “wow” project. </p>



<p><strong><strong>The blockchain dev team for your project might face some difficulties or pitfalls during the implementation process so obtaining such a skill will be a huge plus.</strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do ask for a fixed price</strong></h2>



<p>There are three main types of budgeting IT companies usually have on their list.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/pricing-types.png" alt="pricing types while choosing a blockchain outsourcing company
" class="wp-image-3266" width="799" height="399"/><figcaption><em>The main pricing and budgeting types IT companies offer</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When having a well-prepared technical task in your hands, ask the company for a fixed price cost estimation even if you do not feel like it fits your project. Often companies do not offer this kind of budgeting hiding their ignorance of clear time frames and lack of relevant experience behind thus.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Blaize Recommendation: <strong>Even if you have agreed on an hourly payment type of budget, do not be afraid to ask for a fixed price estimation in addition, because it also helps to check the level of conductor experience. The preparation of such estimation should entail no difficulties if you have a prepared technical task on your part.&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;<strong>Communicate with the dev team directly</strong></h2>



<p>It would be great just to pay money and relax while waiting for a link to the repository of a finished product. Unfortunately, it works only as an advertising slogan rather than real practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communication with the company’s project manager might not be enough to get deeper insights of the development process. Therefore, we recommend checking the willingness of the dev team to carry out daily calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the team meets your expectations and you have agreed on the final proposal, do not be so quick to move this task to the “done” section in Trello and wait for the product launch.</p>



<p>We recommend you to stay in control of the future development processes and schedule work so that the development team is focused on your project solely. If there is not enough time to do it yourself, hire a product manager who will take care of this and represent your interests in the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>Want to hire a solid blockchain development team? </strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/#contacts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Connect with our CEO</strong></a><strong> to see what we can offer!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Check for C-level authority and activity in communities</strong></h2>



<p>C-level (or C-Suite) authorities represent the high-ranked executives in a company. The amount of C-level executives varies from company to company and depends mainly on its size and scale. Accordingly, large outsourcing blockchain subcontractors will have a bigger amount of highly-ranked authorities to distribute the dynamic workflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other thing to take into consideration is the company activities in social media or publications in well-known media communities. As simple as it is, checking a company&#8217;s account in popular media may give you a lot of answers and help to choose reliable blockchain developers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the main alarms of poor blockchain outsourcing?</strong></h2>



<p>We have just told you what to look for while hiring a blockchain development team. Yet, to be able to distinguish a reliable blockchain vendor we recommend looking at a few important features of a poor blockchain outsourcing company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, you can find a rich list of companies that claim to have a dedicated and experienced team of blockchain engineers. Yet, unfortunately, this knowledge may be often exaggerated in some ways.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Very little technical requirements preparation</strong></h2>



<p>We often face the situation where a customer, firstly, contacts business analysts (or) consultants in order to discuss his idea and turn it into a technical requirement (or alternatively fulfills this through his employees).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the project idea is presented in PowerPoint with numerous visual elements, moving arrows and gears spins. It looks good, so he pays money for this and thinks that everything is fine. Typically, 80% of such “technical requirements” are revised and redone by the actual dev team while preparing a technical task for the onboarding process.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="320" height="228" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ezgif-4-7e4acf08f8ac.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-3280"/></figure></div>



<p>Unfortunately, in some cases, the outsource contractors can just follow what is written in the initial technical requirements. This is the worst they can do because a customer will spend money on an inoperable product. Therefore, make sure your dev team prepares a technical task of high quality and makes a thorough business analysis to eliminate tech collisions.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An experienced team of blockchain developers is capable of preparing a technical requirement for you while having just your idea as a base. Turning such a technical requirement into a tech task will not be a problem if prepared by the same team. Thus, you will save a considerable amount of time.&nbsp;</strong></h5>



<p>So feel free to come just with the idea to outsource, but evaluate the competency the company has to accomplish such a task.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Claiming too much experience</strong></h2>



<p>Next common example of an unsuitable company is when the company declares more than 7 or 10 years of blockchain development experience. Such a long practice in the field is nearly impossible because it was really hard to imagine the application of blockchain technology in any industry until the beginning of Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, before 2015 blockchain had not been used anywhere except for cryptocurrencies while its adaptation seemed really questionable and unrealistic. Therefore, <strong>if a certain company claims it has 7 or even 10 years of experience in blockchain development ask for Satoshi Nakamoto to be in charge of your project</strong>. The real boom and breakthrough in blockchain development began only in 2017-18.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blockchain as one among others&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Another distinctive feature of blockchain outsourcing is that many companies came into this area while already providing other types of IT services. Dealing with classic development, back-end, or even front-end solutions, they simply added blockchain to the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/what-to-expect-blaize-predictions-of-blockchain-development-trends-in-2021/">list of technologies</a> they offer when the blockchain “hype” started in 2018.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Practically, this neither fits the first nor the second blockchain development approach we described above. Mainly because it is impossible to quickly learn high-quality programming or a list of new languages. The same as there is a very low possibility of gaining vast experience in proper blockchain architecture building within a short period of time.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Hence, If you need a blockchain, go to a blockchain company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Blaize is a dedicated blockchain development firm for hire?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Blockchain technology is gathering more attention, so bigger amount of people want to integrate it to their businesses. In this article we are going to examine pros and cons of blockchain integration in terms of a startup or a big company. </p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Technology overview</h5>



<p>Since its emergence, blockchain technology has undergone several developmental stages, not to mention phases of speculative hype. This trend shows no signs of abating any time soon. In fact, the blockchain industry is still very much in its infancy and continues to rapidly evolve and diversify.<br></p>



<p>What started as a supportive technology for bitcoin (and, quickly, other cryptocurrencies) has evolved into a distributed, trustless platform to build and run decentralized applications on top (Ethereum, EOS and other Ethereum-like projects). Applications that could have a great many non-currency applications, while preserving all the advantages that blockchain technology introduced in the first place.<br></p>



<p>In the early stages, there were only a handful of visionaries and enthusiasts who pushed the technology forward. Afterwards, as the concept gained wider popularity, it attracted new talent and entrepreneurs leading to the advent of various blockchain projects and startups.<br></p>



<p>In 2014, major companies began to enter the space in earnest. Predominantly, the newcomers were those who identified the need for blockchain technology to fulfil their own ambitions. Additionally, corporations like Microsoft and corporate entities like<a href="https://www.r3.com/"> R3</a> adopted the technology.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The 2017 bitcoin bull run followed by 2018 ICO mania caused interest in blockchain technology to reach an all-time high. Although it also brought many scam and money-grabbing projects to life, the subsequent Crypto Winter mostly cleared the space of non-viable ones.<br></p>



<p>In 2019, the blockchain market enjoyed a transformational maturation, wherein venture and institutional investors began to dominate.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-701"/></figure></div>



<p><em>Fig. 1. Stages of blockchain technology adoption in terms of entities entering the market </em></p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading">Startup vs. Corporation<br></h5>



<p>Needless to say, the culture of a major corporation is drastically different from that of a young startup.<br></p>



<p>First of all, in terms of the availability of resources. Even accounting for the crowdfunding model for new projects (<a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/analysis/how-to-launch-an-ico-sto-or-ieo-in-2023-benefits-tips-best-practices/">ICO</a>), a startup typically struggles continually for financial and other resources. And that’s only part of the problem since a startup has a persistent need for proving its idea’s real-life usefulness and business viability. On top of that, a typical startup completely or partially lacks established and/or properly functioning business processes. Thus the risk of a startup failing to survive the next year (or sometimes even the next month) is very real.<br></p>



<p>A major enterprise or corporation is entirely different, relying as it does upon well-tuned business processes as well as internal operations. It benefits from an established position in the market, a position which tends to provide at the very least steady cash flow and revenue. Such enterprises typically have fewer money/resource problems, encounter fewer risks, and are not locked in a ceaseless battle for survival (at least not a dramatic one – however any business risks falling victim to competition or the next radical economic, technological or market change).<br></p>



<p>At the same time, a corporation has mostly ‘defensive’ motivation. It seeks to remain relevant in an ever-changing world, to ‘be in trend,’ to ‘maintain momentum’ etc. It is usually slow and bulky, overly bureaucratized, characterized by a low level of dedication from employees and even senior managers. And those guys wear suits!<br></p>



<p>On the other hand, a startup possesses more than a simple desire to survive. It seeks to change the world as we know it, to do something that really matters. With great dedication and passion. That is the fundamental nature of a young, brave startup – the guys in jeans and t-shirts.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">The choice<br></h5>



<p>So, for engineers of service <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/opinion/top-10-blockchain-development-companies-for-2023/">blockchain companies</a> all over the world, there is a choice to be made: Who to work with? With whom to endure the hardships? Well, at least the best ones can really have that choice.<br></p>



<p>Before we get to the choice itself, let’s consider what ultimately motivates those engineers.<br></p>



<p>Good engineers strive for the most effective application of their knowledge and expertise, the creation of disruptive world-changing products and services, and of course a broadening and deepening of their own experience by solving difficult technical tasks.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>If you read the previous section carefully, you will know which of the two types of clients better embody these ambitions. And so you can give a pretty accurate answer to the fundamental question.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">What choice did we make?<br></h5>



<p>Naturally, working with a big corporation has its own pronounced benefits: it’s stable, they have customers, they have money, they often know exactly what they need and what they don’t need. And obviously it could be very profitable.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In contrast, working with a startup can be chaotic, problematic, less economically attractive and so forth. We could also be struggling with the same issues our client is struggling with due to the unpredictable and unstable nature of startups.<br></p>



<p>And yet, at <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://blaize.tech/">Blaize</a></strong> we prefer t-shirts over suits.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Why? Because when you work with a <a href="https://blaize.tech/for-startups/">startup blockchain development</a>, the chances to transform the world we all live in are much higher than if you stick with a slow, bulky, dinosaur-like corporation.<br></p>



<p>We are the sort of people who hold dear the values startup founders espouse. We are the same breed as they are. So we want to cooperate with those whom we like and understand. With those whose vision we can help bring to reality. All of this is extremely important to us.<br></p>



<p>Since we deeply understand the nature of startups, we have certain principles when dealing with our clients. We don’t want to take away key competencies that the core team is to deliver. We don’t wish to distort founders’ hypotheses or damage companies’ unique DNA, which is integral for its future and for the value it seeks to bring to life.<br></p>



<p>Our aim is to help you, not a substitute for you in the things that are crucial for your business. And definitely not to cause you even more problems than you already have with your <a href="https://blaize.tech/for-enterprises/">new enterprise</a>. Rather, we aim to reduce their number and/or severity.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>By the way, in previous article <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/in-house-vs-outsource-blockchain-dev-team/">In-house vs Outsource</a> we help startups to understand whether they need to turn to an outsource or look for some new players to join thier full-time team. <br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Companies around the globe find more and more <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-develop-blockchain-based-lending-platform/">benefits blockchain-based solutions</a> can bring. Yet, right after you decide to turn into this cutting edge market, the important question occurs: <strong>what is better in-house vs outsource blockchain development team?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Additionally, this is not a dilemma just for young entrepreneurs or new-born startups. Well-established mid-sized or large companies face the very same problem: maintenance and support of existing blockchain-based solutions that will drive their product or service to the heights it deserves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we answer the common questions regarding in-house blockchain development vs outsourcing and explain their differences. Also, we will tell what type of businesses may benefit or lose from each of those solutions.&nbsp;Therefore, in the end, you can make an informed decision about what is best for your in-house or outsourcing model for blockchain development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pros and cons of in-house blockchain developers</h2>



<p>If you do not know who to entrust the blockchain development &#8211; in-house or outsourcing, check out the benefits of both. Primary, every blockchain entrepreneur has to understand that hiring a dedicated blockchain development team will not be an easy task. As far as there is a high demand for skilled developers in this field, you have to prepare yourself for a desperate struggle for the heart of a good blockchain engineer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you finally found one, it might bring more control to your hands and increase the effectiveness of task fulfillment. Let’s take a closer look at the list of the advantages and disadvantages of this model.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1005" height="1076" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blaze_291120.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7585"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros of in-house team</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Potentially better control over the process and final result</strong></li></ul>



<p>Since the whole work process happens within your own company and is executed by your own employees, you have the ability to exercise better control over both the team and the development itself. Additionally, you are able to receive and immediate feedback from your engineers and react to it in a faster and more effective way.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong><strong>Higher expertise &amp; specialization in a particular subject area</strong></strong></li></ul>



<p>Since internal specialists constantly deal with the same or similar scope of problems, they learn to master their skills better, becoming highly-focused professionals in this particular field. This may raise the quality of their work and the development process drastically.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Technical independence of the project</strong></li></ul>



<p>Naturally your project gains more technical independence from external experts in the case of in-house development. All key technical competencies remain within the company. This impacts not only the development process itself, but also tech support capabilities of the core team as well as the possibility to maintain the product/service over time.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Immediate instructions and changes</strong></li></ul>



<p>As far as you are in charge of the team, you are able to give immediate feedback and instruction regarding the working process or project scope itself. In terms of additional changes it helps to insert or discuss them nearly as soon as they come to your mind.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Product maintenance</strong></li></ul>



<p>Choosing an in-house blockchain development model may help to save time and costs in terms of further servicing and maintenance of your product. If the same team takes care of your product after the release, there is no need to spend time explaining what exactly is broken and how it should work.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cons of in-house&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Huge costs</strong></li></ul>



<p>Building an effective and fully capable in-house dev team requires significant investment of both money and organizational efforts. This is highly visible especially at the initial stages (including paying a large amount of related costs like equipment, insurance, premises, social packages, taxes, etc).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus you will be spending money even at times of forced or natural inactivity (since your own staff need to be paid anyway). In most cases, an in-house blockchain dev team will cost you much more than any alternative option.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Starving headhunters</strong></li></ul>



<p>Along with the high cost, there is even bigger risk of maintaining your own in-house devs. While your company has invested significant amounts of money into finding and raising internal specialists, they can always go away to the competition or to pursue their own projects, and your company will end up with needing to find and invest in new team members all over again.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Limited expertise&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>This is the other side of the coin in terms of higher specialization of your staff. Your own team becomes more and more narrowly specialized, which is good in terms of performance and effectiveness in one particular field.</p>



<p>But in case external or internal fluctuations require any changes to be made, this could become a huge problem. As a result, your company lacks the needed flexibility and work speed that is so important to be on top of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there may be a need for extra expenses for external specialists to handle your request.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Limited time</strong></li></ul>



<p>Looking for a good and experienced specialist in any area is a challenge while in blockchain you should triple the effort you put into it. Therefore, <strong>companies can spend months to years searching for skilled specialists.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who benefits from the in-house blockchain development team?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>To make a decision, you also need to understand who will benefit from in-house blockchain development and outsourcing. As you already know, if building an internal blockchain team, you have to be ready to get a lot out of your pockets along with committing much time for its building from the beginning. So the question is if the juice is worth the squeeze?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer depends on the purpose and, mainly, the size of the<strong> </strong>project you have in mind. <strong>Having an in-house blockchain development team is suitable in case of providing a huge product development.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://polkadot.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polkadot</a> is a good example of such a project. This is a very scalable product that will interact with a list of existing networks and new, upcoming projects. Therefore, it will surely require constant maintenance by a huge team of developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong><em>Find out more about Polkadot ecosystem and its upcoming startups in <a href="https://blaize.tech/services/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>However, we have to underline that today it is approximately impossible to find a skilled senior blockchain developer due to such points as a quite young market in terms of blockchain adoption and lack of expertise in several blockchain technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Now it is more common to find a developer with a good command in one or maybe two languages and some basic knowledge of the blockchain. Yet, for the development of a good product that is not enough so you will probably need to wait for several months or even a year for building a really skilled blockchain in-house team.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pros and cons of outsourcing blockchain development&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We believe that outsourcing blockchain development is better than in-house. Outsourcing has already proven its usability and cost-effectiveness for businesses of different types and sizes. Especially when talking about narrow markets where it is often hard to find good specialists for required tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain is a fastly developing niche, and there are still not enough developers having strong technical knowledge and a few years of experience under their belts. So if finding a blockchain specialist is a difficult task, turning to outsource is a very wise idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reliable outsourcing blockchain company will have a team of experienced developers with a rich list of skills and can carry out various tasks. Let’s take a closer look at the advantages of outsourcing blockchain development and its possible weaknesses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1878" height="959" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blaze_291120_3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7583" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blaze_291120_3.png 1878w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blaze_291120_3-1536x784.png 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blaze_291120_3-1568x801.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1878px) 100vw, 1878px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros of blockchain outsourcing:</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Streamlined &amp; optimized development processes</strong></li></ul>



<p>This is one of the most crucial advantages of outsourced development. All development and accompanied business processes are well established and properly set up by the outsourcing developers team. This is something a young company lacks by definition since it is a newly created company with no pre-set processes.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Better TTM (Time To Market) index</strong></li></ul>



<p>Another big and important advantage of hiring a blockchain outsourcing company. An outsourced agency typically offers a ready-to-go highly experienced team without the need to go through time-consuming staffing processes. This helps to save a significant amount of time and effort. Thus you are able to deliver your vision to the market much faster and with less hassle.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Easier &amp; faster workforce scaling&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>In case a situation requires fast or temporary team expansion you do not have to worry about hiring additional specialists. Outsourcing companies usually have specialists with a rich list of capabilities and experience. So you can seamlessly transfer another additional task to them, which is not the case if you do it all by yourself and in-house.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Cost-effectiveness&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>This is probably one of the most essential benefits of outsourced development that is very important for any kind of business, from a small new born startup to a large enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often external specialists will cost you significantly less than building your own in-house team. Potentially they will have more practical experience and your company can react faster and more effectively if an unusual problem arises.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li><strong>Time-efficiency</strong></li></ul>



<p>In addition to a higher TTM index, outsourcing your blockchain development will also save the time needed for hiring and management of the team. In terms of outsourcing, you get a tight-knit team that is ready to take on your task. When in the case of in-house you will have to invest your time into the tiring processes of headhunting.</p>



<ul><li><strong>A rich list of tools &amp; technologies</strong></li></ul>



<p>An outsourcing company often deals with projects from different spheres. Therefore its programmers can offer a wider list of skills and technologies they specialize in. You can also check the <a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/">company’s portfolio</a> and see a case similar to your project to be sure they know how to do it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cons of blockchain outsourcing:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Expertise stays outside the company</strong></li></ul>



<p>An obvious drawback of dev outsourcing is that technical expertise comes from outside the company and stays out there. However, this may be not that critical if engineering itself is not the main area where your enterprise innovates. Or you can just outsource less critical and more trivial parts of your tech to an external contractor while keeping the key components for your own in-house specialists.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Lesser control</strong></li></ul>



<p>Another issue that may occur while having an external team is a lack of direct communication with team members. This could lead to miscommunication and lesser transparency. This however could be fixed by choosing the right contractor and setting proper preliminary agreements on effective communication procedures, reporting, etc.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Language barrier</strong></li></ul>



<p>Many companies work with specialists from all around the globe. Despite the worldwide popularization of English and considering it as the first IT language, there is still a place for misunderstanding. This may lead to longer discussions during the discovery stage.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why hire an outsourcing blockchain development company?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>It is reasonable to outsource your blockchain project instead of opting for an in-house because of many factors. First of all, if you choose to outsource you will get a well-organized team with various skills and technologies in its portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second of all, experience with similar projects is also a huge advantage of outsourcing. Moreover, vast experience helps to enhance team creativity and flexibility of approaches they offer. Thus, you will be able to deliver a competitive solution while saving your own production costs &amp; time.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-primary-red-color"><em>Hire a blockchain outsourcing is highly recommended:&nbsp;</em></span></strong></h4>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hybrid model: Outsourced + In-house Approach</h2>



<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to say which is better outsourcing blockchain development or in-house. The blockchain market has grown a lot these days. Greater tools and newer technologies along with <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/5-best-programming-languages-for-blockchain-development/">blockchain programming languages</a> appear constantly. Therefore often one or a couple of specialists cannot cover all expected requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, you will need the help of third-party specialists one way or another. Then, it might be reasonable to consider a hybrid model where to combine the workforce of your in-house developers with outsourced blockchain developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background"><em><strong>Want to start your blockchain development as soon as possible?</strong> You don’t have to wait for your in-house programmers to reach the needed level. Start your project now while <a href="https://blaize.tech/#contacts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outsourcing a part of work to Blaize</a>! Due to smooth cooperation, your project will grow along with the skill level of your in-house developers.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>This approach will create a favorable environment for more efficient planning and analysis and provide the ability to choose which tasks to delegate to which team, so you can fine-tune your processes in the most effective way while optimizing the costs.</p>



<p>As one of the main disadvantages of this model, there may be potential difficulties in the connection between your employees and outsourced developers (language barrier, time zone, cultural predispositions).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The larger is the market you enter, the more qualifications you need to keep up with competitors and deliver more cost-effective solutions. In-House vs outsource blockchain development is an important decision to make at the very beginning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of blockchain, technology development is highly rapid, so you more often have to be fast to catch a break. In such cases, hiring an outsourcing company is the best solution. It will be suitable for any dApp development, <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-amm-works-technology-basics/">DEX</a>, staking platform, <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-create-and-deploy-a-smart-contract-in-a-secure-way/">smart contract creation</a>, or custom blockchain development for enterprise solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong><em>Looking for solid blockchain outsourcing?

<p>We recommend considering an in-house approach in terms of building a very scalable project which is entirely dependent on the blockchain and requires ongoing maintenance purposes. Any of existing chains like Ethereum, <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-launch-a-project-on-polkadot-dapp-parachain-and-bridge/">Polkadot</a>, Near, EOS, etc., can be an example for such.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, due to the high risks that come with adopting an in-house model many entrepreneurs often see it reasonable to outsource a blockchain ecosystem development to reduce costs &amp; time. You can see one of our <a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/remme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful use cases</a> in terms of implementing the whole blockchain ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><strong>In Blaize, we have been building our team since 2016 so now we can surely claim vast experience and knowledge in the blockchain field. It is worth mentioning that the ability to work on several projects from one field yet concentrate on different subjects is one of the biggest assets of our outsourcing team.</strong></strong></p>



<p>For instance, working on a couple of different DeFi projects gives us an opportunity to see and find even better solutions on how to optimize and enhance future projects. This is the biggest advantage of outsourcing blockchain development vs in-house.&nbsp;</p>
