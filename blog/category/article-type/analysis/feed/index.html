Ethereum and Polygon require global compliance considerations, Arbitrum and Avalanche must navigate U.S. regulations, Cosmos benefits from Switzerland&#8217;s favorable laws, and BNB Smart Chain&#8217;s association with Binance requires careful legal navigation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Compliance with AML/KYC Requirements</h3>



<p>Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations is essential for legal operation and user trust.</p>



<p><strong>Ethereum</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance Approach</strong>: Largely decentralized; compliance is enforced at the application level by individual projects.</li>



<li><strong>Note</strong>: Projects must implement their own AML/KYC measures where necessary.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Polygon</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance Approach</strong>: Similar to Ethereum; developers are responsible for ensuring compliance.</li>



<li><strong>Note</strong>: Layer 2 solutions require attention to regulatory compliance at the application layer.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance Approach</strong>: Projects must adhere to AML/KYC requirements, especially given U.S. jurisdiction.</li>



<li><strong>Comment</strong>: Developers should be vigilant about compliance due to potential regulatory scrutiny.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cosmos</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance Approach</strong>: Provides tools for identity verification and compliance within its ecosystem.</li>



<li><strong>Note</strong>: Supports compliance through modular development, allowing for customized AML/KYC solutions.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Note</strong>: The association with Binance may impose stricter compliance expectations.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Avalanche</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance Approach</strong>: Offers features to facilitate compliance, including customizable subnets that can enforce AML/KYC.</li>



<li><strong>Note</strong>: Avalanche&#8217;s enterprise focus necessitates robust compliance capabilities.</li>
</ul>



<p>While the underlying blockchains are decentralized, compliance is critical at the application level. Ethereum and Polygon place the responsibility on developers, Arbitrum and Avalanche emphasize compliance due to U.S. regulations, Cosmos provides modular solutions, and BNB Smart Chain&#8217;s ties to Binance highlight the importance of adherence to AML/KYC standards.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Performance and User-Friendliness</h2>



<p>The usability and accessibility of blockchain platforms are key factors in driving mass adoption.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">User Experience and Interfaces</h3>



<p>A blockchain’s user experience (UX) is defined by how seamlessly users can interact with wallets, applications, and network features.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ethereum</strong>:<br>Ethereum offers a mature UX ecosystem with wallets like <strong>MetaMask</strong> and integrations with Web3 browsers. However, high gas fees and slower transaction speeds during peak activity remain challenges. Developers are actively addressing these issues through Layer 2 solutions, which improve transaction efficiency and reduce user friction.</li>



<li><strong>Polygon</strong>:<br>Polygon’s low fees and high throughput provide a frictionless experience for DApps. The ecosystem integrates seamlessly with Ethereum-based wallets and tools, ensuring a familiar interface for Ethereum users while offering better performance.</li>



<li><strong>Arbitrum</strong>:<br>Designed as a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, Arbitrum emphasizes user efficiency. Wallets like <strong>MetaMask</strong> and DApps built on Arbitrum are almost indistinguishable from their Ethereum counterparts, offering a consistent experience with improved transaction speeds.</li>



<li><strong>Cosmos</strong>:<br>Cosmos emphasizes interoperability, but its modular approach may require users to interact with multiple wallets or tools for different chains. Wallets like <strong>Keplr</strong> simplify the process, but the user experience can vary across chains.</li>



<li><strong>BNB Smart Chain</strong>:<br>With low fees and Binance ecosystem integration, BNB Smart Chain appeals to retail users. Wallets like <strong>Trust Wallet</strong> provide a beginner-friendly interface, though its centralized model may limit advanced functionalities.</li>



<li><strong>Avalanche</strong>:<br>Avalanche’s <strong>Avalanche Wallet</strong> offers a clean and intuitive design for managing assets and staking. Its subnet functionality adds complexity but allows for tailored user experiences in enterprise applications.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Availability and Support for Multiple Platforms</h3>



<p>Accessibility across devices and platforms determines how well a blockchain caters to diverse user needs.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Desktop and Mobile Support</strong>:<br>Most platforms, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche, offer robust desktop and mobile wallet support. Apps like <strong>Trust Wallet</strong> and <strong>MetaMask Mobile</strong> are widely adopted.</li>



<li><strong>Cross-Platform Consistency</strong>:<br>Arbitrum and Polygon excel in delivering consistent experiences across platforms, thanks to their Ethereum compatibility. Cosmos provides cross-chain access but may require different tools for specific chains, introducing variability.</li>



<li><strong>Specialized Features</strong>:<br>Avalanche’s subnet feature enables custom applications optimized for unique device ecosystems, such as enterprise-focused mobile DApps.</li>
</ul>



<p>User experience remains a priority for all platforms, with Ethereum setting the standard for wallet compatibility and interface maturity. Polygon and Arbitrum enhance usability by improving Ethereum’s transaction efficiency, while Cosmos and Avalanche emphasize flexibility and customization. BNB Smart Chain, with its retail focus, prioritizes simplicity and accessibility for new users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since its inception, the blockchain industry has been synonymous with immense potential, attracting technocrats, investors, and entrepreneurs alike. Yet, the barriers to entry, amplified by the influx of myriad projects in 2023, demand more than just technological brilliance. The quick growth in popularity of the industry caused the growth of competition inside the market. A thoughtfully-crafted blockchain marketing strategy is what weaves the threads of innovation into a tapestry of success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let the numbers speak. The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $21.43B, the total volume in DeFi is currently $1.66B, and the total volume of all stablecoins is now $19.8B. These mind-breaking figures perfectly illustrate how perspective and prosperous the crypto &amp; blockchain market is. And indeed, choosing a marketing solution that fits is half the way to success.</p>



<p>Drawing from our deep well of experience at Blaize, this guide unveils a treasure trove of insights. Aimed to equip young projects with the wisdom to navigate the crypto labyrinth, it serves as a beacon to amplify ROI.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Crypto and Blockchain Marketing?</h2>



<p>Crypto and blockchain marketing isn&#8217;t merely about promoting a new type of product &#8211; it&#8217;s about pioneering trust in a revolutionary financial paradigm. At its core, this type of marketing navigates the distinctive landscape of the cryptocurrency world, weaving tales that foster trust, promote transparency and fuel adoption.</p>



<p>Traditional products often rely on tangible benefits and a history of trust. In contrast, crypto projects are venturing into largely uncharted territories, requiring a more nuanced approach. Strategies have to be agile, responsive to the market&#8217;s pulse, and hyper-aware of the stakeholders involved.</p>



<p>Stat: <em>A report from Statista revealed that the number of blockchain wallet users increased from less than 10 million in 2016 to over 60 million in 2020 (Source: Statista, 2020).</em> This exponential rise underscores the importance of effective crypto marketing, as the competition for these users&#8217; attention has intensified.</p>



<p>Coupled with the dynamism of the 2023 crypto market, distinguishing oneself demands a deep understanding of unique metrics like community sentiment, regulatory shifts, and technological advancements. Effective blockchain marketing strategy and crypto content marketing have thus become indispensable tools in a project’s arsenal, paving the way for success in an increasingly crowded space.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Main Challenges Faced by New Blockchain Projects</h2>



<p>Launching a new blockchain project is an ambitious endeavor, but it comes with a set of unique challenges that must be navigated effectively. This section offers an introductory overview of the primary challenges that new blockchain projects often encounter and provides insights on how to address them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Market Volatility</strong></h3>



<p>The crypto market, by nature, experiences significant fluctuations. It&#8217;s an environment where a tweet, regulatory news, or a technological glitch can swing valuations wildly.</p>



<p><em>In 2021, the cryptocurrency market saw its value halve within just a few months, only to rebound again (Source: CoinMarketCap, 2021).</em> This rollercoaster of values can challenge even the most well-laid marketing plans, as projects grapple with investor sentiment and market stability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Emerging Industry Dynamics</strong></h3>



<p>Being a relatively nascent field, blockchain often feels like shifting sands. Continuous technological innovations, regulatory shifts, and changing public perceptions make it a fluid industry.</p>



<p><em>As of 2022, more than 70% of central banks were exploring the concept of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), showcasing the evolving stance on digital currencies (Source: Bank for International Settlements, 2022).</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scam Projects and Mistrust</strong></h3>



<p>The rise of scam projects and fraudulent schemes casts shadows of doubt. Legitimate projects must now undertake the added responsibility of proving their genuineness and dispelling skepticism.</p>



<p>Stat: <em>Approximately $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency was estimated to be stolen and scammed in 2018 alone (Source: CipherTrace Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2019).</em> For budding blockchain endeavors, building trust is paramount.</p>

<p>In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, effective marketing strategies are essential to stand out and succeed. This section provides an introductory overview of the best marketing strategies for the crypto space, offering valuable insights for navigating this competitive landscape.</p>



<p>Marketing in the crypto sphere requires a unique approach due to its complex, ever-evolving nature. To thrive, you need to be not only innovative but also strategic in your marketing efforts. Here, we&#8217;ll explore the core principles that underpin the best crypto marketing strategies.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Focus on SEO From the Early Stages</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Focus on commercial (money) keywords. Start from low, competitive keywords, as it&#8217;s much easier to get visibility.</li>



<li>Content is king. Write for people, not for robots, but do not forget about organizing keywords on the page in a proper way</li>



<li>Build your external signals. The more info about you/your business on the web, the more understandable you are for robots &amp; people. So, build backlinks, get reviews on the platform, and get a social presence. All this works perfectly for SEO.</li>
</ul>

<li>Engaging Design: Incorporate visuals and infographics to break down complex concepts.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Focus on community management</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Engage Actively: Regularly interact with your audience on platforms like Telegram, Discord, and Reddit.</li>



<li>Feedback Loop: Take community feedback seriously and make them feel part of the project&#8217;s journey.</li>
</ul>



<p>Stat: <em>Brands that engage with their audience on social media platforms enjoy a 33% higher conversion rate (Source: Social Media Today, 2020).</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Content marketing</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Informative Blogs: Write about industry trends, project updates, and educate your audience.</li>



<li>Guest Posts: Collaborate with well-established crypto platforms for wider reach.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Airdrops</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Increase Adoption: Offer free tokens to potential users, increasing awareness and user base. But one should consider that airdrops as a tool must be used consciously. Sometimes the situation happens when the community is ‘filled up’ with freebie lovers, and after you’re finished with airdrops the community remains completely inactive. Therefore, this tool must be combined with other community activation tools.</li>
</ul>



<p>Stat: <em>Airdrops can increase token ownership dispersion by 50% or more (Source: ICO Marketing Guide, 2019).</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Maintain Regular Communication</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Newsletters: Keep stakeholders updated with monthly or weekly newsletters, optimizing for crypto email marketing.</li>



<li>AMA Sessions: Hold &#8220;Ask Me Anything&#8221; sessions to foster transparency.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Email marketing</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Segmentation: Segment your email list to provide targeted and relevant information.</li>



<li>Engaging Content: Use visuals and engaging copy to captivate the recipient&#8217;s attention.</li>
</ul>



<p>Stat: <em>Email marketing has an average ROI of 3,800% for </em><em>businesses </em><em>(Source: DMA, 2020).</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PR Campaign</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Press Releases: Regularly send out announcements to well-known crypto publications.</li>



<li>Collaborations: Partner with influencers or trusted figures in the crypto space for interviews.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Paid Advertising</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Targeted Ads: Use platforms like Google, Meta (Facebook and Instagram), Twitter, and TikTok or specialized crypto ad networks for reaching the right audience.</li>
</ul>



<p>Stat: <em>Crypto-specific ad platforms have seen a surge in usage, with a 59% increase in ad impressions year-on-year as of 2022 (Source: Brave Browser Insights, 2022).</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Social Media Presence</h3>



<ul>
<li>Active Engagement: Regularly post and engage with the community on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</li>



<li>High-Quality Expert Content: Create various trendy content on domestic platforms as well as in journals, newspapers, etc. That can include interviews, how-to-make videos, infographics, and memes.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the adoption of blockchain technology skyrockets, public networks are witnessing an influx of users like never before. Ethereum, renowned for its security, stands out as the most popular of these networks. Yet, this security comes with a trade-off – scalability and transaction costs. Although the anticipated migration to Proof-of-Stake promises to mitigate these issues, Ethereum&#8217;s scalability challenges and high fees persist.</p>



<p>However, a solution that offers better scalability, enhanced user experience, and lower fees is already here, and it&#8217;s known as Layer-2 networks. Layer-2 networks, or L2 networks, are built on top of existing Layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin, leveraging their security while significantly enhancing their scalability and efficiency. These networks strike an impressive balance between maintaining security and decentralization and offering improved scalability and reduced fees.</p>

<p>Starting from the very beginning of the year 2023, the L2 solutions market has been growing sharply. As of May 2023, <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl">the TVL</a> of the Layer 2 solutions market is estimated at $8,49 billion. Summing up the aforementioned, one central question arises: what is so sophisticated about L2 blockchain solutions? Let&#8217;s take a closer look at it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="537" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-33288"/><figcaption><a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl">Source</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Are Scaling Solutions Necessary?</h2>



<p>Blockchain technology, despite its transformative potential, grapples with a few significant challenges. Scalability, transaction finality, and limited transaction throughput are the most prominent among these. Moreover, with growing network congestion, users often face enormous gas fees, which can be a deterrent for many. Security risks, coupled with the need for increased privacy, also persist as pertinent concerns in the realm of blockchain.</p>



<p>In this context, Layer 2 scaling solutions emerge as a beacon of hope. They are designed to tackle these issues head-on, offering an efficient way to enhance blockchain&#8217;s potential. For <a href="https://blaize.tech/smart-contracts/">smart contract developers</a>, these solutions can be particularly beneficial. By utilizing Layer-2 scaling solutions, developers can significantly improve scalability and throughput without making substantial changes to the smart contract code.</p>



<p>This ability to scale and increase transaction capacity while maintaining the integrity of the underlying smart contract is an instrumental advantage. Layer-2 solutions, thus, serve as a critical tool for overcoming the inherent limitations of blockchain technology, paving the way for its wider adoption and more innovative applications.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">At the same time, it’s quite important to maintain the highest level of security for blockchain projects, regardless of the blockchain you build on. Blaize has published an <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/web3-security/how-to-create-and-deploy-a-smart-contract-in-a-secure-way/">article</a> on how to create and deploy a secure smart contract. Feel free to discover the topic on our website.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are Layer 2 Scaling Solutions and How Do They Work?</h2>



<p>Layer-2 scaling solutions are a form of blockchain technology designed to sit atop existing Layer-1 networks, such as Ethereum. Their primary goal is to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs associated with the underlying network. They achieve this by processing transactions off-chain and subsequently storing these transactions in batches on the Ethereum network.</p>



<p>This approach brings significant benefits, the most noteworthy of which is near-instant transaction finality. Unlike on Ethereum where users often have to wait for extended periods for transaction acceptance or rejection, Layer-2 solutions offer a near-instantaneous response. This means that transactions on Layer-2 networks are processed and confirmed almost instantly, resulting in a vastly improved user experience.</p>



<p>Despite processing transactions off-chain, Layer-2 solutions ensure all data associated with transactions and blocks are posted on-chain on Ethereum. By doing so, these solutions inherit the robust security framework of the Layer-1 network. Validators in Layer-2 networks play a critical role in this context. Their main task is to maintain the validity of the blockchain state and ensure that invalid transactions are not accepted. This model thus enhances the scalability and speed of transactions while preserving the underlying network&#8217;s security and decentralization.</p>



<p>Mentioning L2 solutions, many people tend to imagine an Ethereum-like structure with multiple chain branches. However, the reality is that L2 emerges around various L1 chains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, platforms such as Polkadot and Cosmos were specifically designed to enable infinite scalability by incorporating L2 solutions. Avalanche, on the other hand, aims to provide a dedicated subnet for each dApp. Even Bitcoin has its own L2 called Stacks. It is interesting to note, that Solana is currently engaged in discussions regarding its plans for implementing L2 solutions. Additionally, dYdX is an excellent example of an L2 solution tailored for a single dApp, with StarkWare creating its own sidechain exclusively for that protocol.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Layer 1 vs. Layer 2: What are The Differences?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/4-2.png" alt="Layer 2 solutions aim to boost the scalability, speed, and efficiency of the base layer utilizing its security and consensus mechanisms." class="wp-image-33294"/></figure>



<p>Layer-1, including networks like Ethereum, represents the base layer of blockchain technology. It possesses its own chain of blocks, rules for validating transactions, and mechanisms to add blocks to the chain, as well as security measures. On the other hand, Layer-2 is the next tier, constructed atop the base blockchain. It aims to boost the scalability, speed, and efficiency of the base layer while also utilizing its security and consensus mechanisms. Let&#8217;s delve into the key distinctions between these two layers:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transaction Processing</strong></h3>



<p>Layer-1 networks process transactions on-chain, meaning every transaction is recorded directly onto the blockchain. This approach can restrict the number of transactions that can be processed simultaneously, leading to slower transaction speeds and higher fees during periods of high network congestion. The L2 solutions exhibit distinct mechanics. These mechanisms range from entirely off-chain processes to using dedicated subchains within the L2 system. This off-chain processing allows for faster, more efficient transaction processing, as transactions can be batched and processed in parallel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security</strong></h3>



<p>Layer-1 networks are generally more secure than Layer-2 networks, as each transaction is directly recorded on the blockchain and validated by the network&#8217;s nodes. Layer-2 networks, however, leverage the security of the Layer-1 network. Consequently, compromising the Layer-1 network&#8217;s security could also affect the Layer-2 network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Consensus</strong></h3>



<p>Layer-1 networks employ a consensus mechanism, such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. In contrast, Layer-2 networks utilize different consensus mechanisms, like state channels or sidechains, to validate transactions off-chain. Furthermore, Layer-2 networks inherit the security aspects of the Layer-1 network&#8217;s consensus mechanism.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Decentralization</strong></h3>



<p>Layer-1 networks are generally more decentralized than Layer-2 networks, as every node on the network participates in the consensus mechanism and validates transactions. Layer-2 networks, however, may be more centralized as they rely on a smaller set of nodes to validate transactions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Functionality</strong></h3>



<p>The functionality of Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks also varies significantly. Layer-1 networks, such as Ethereum, offer a robust platform for developing and executing smart contracts, providing a foundation for decentralized applications (DApps). Layer-2 networks, on the other hand, are designed to augment the functionality of Layer-1 networks, offering improved transaction throughput, reduced fees, and potentially expanded capabilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Advantages of Layer-2 Solutions</h2>



<p>Layer-2 solutions bring a plethora of advantages to the table, overcoming the inherent limitations of Layer-1 blockchains. Let&#8217;s explore these benefits in detail:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lower Fees</strong></h3>



<p>One of the key advantages of Layer-2 solutions is the significantly reduced transaction fees. By batching transactions off-chain and posting them on-chain in aggregate, Layer-2 solutions mitigate the high fees associated with executing transactions on Layer-1 networks like Ethereum. This feature makes Layer-2 networks more economically viable, particularly for applications involving a high volume of transactions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Maintain Security</strong></h3>



<p>Layer-2 solutions inherit the security of their underlying Layer-1 network. This means that despite processing transactions off-chain, Layer-2 solutions maintain the robust security features of the main blockchain network. Transactions and block data are posted on-chain, ensuring the security and integrity of the network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scalability</strong></h3>



<p>Layer-2 solutions greatly enhance the scalability of the blockchain network. By processing transactions off-chain, these solutions significantly increase the network&#8217;s transaction throughput. This allows for faster and more efficient transaction processing, as transactions can be batched and processed in parallel.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Instant Transaction Finality</strong></h3>



<p>With Layer-2 solutions, users no longer need to wait for extended periods for transaction acceptance or rejection, as seen with Layer-1 networks like Ethereum. Layer-2 solutions offer a near-instantaneous response, meaning transactions on these networks are processed and confirmed almost instantly. This feature significantly enhances user experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of Layer-2 Scaling Solutions</h2>



<p>Layer-2 scaling solutions come in different shapes and sizes, each addressing the scalability problem uniquely. Let&#8217;s delve into the most common types of Layer-2 solutions:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>State Channels</strong></h3>



<p>State channels are one of the earliest forms of Layer-2 scaling solutions. They allow participants to transact with each other directly off-chain, with the blockchain serving as a judge in case of disputes. The participants open an off-chain channel by creating a multi-signature transaction on the blockchain, and they can transact with each other an unlimited number of times off-chain. Once they&#8217;re done transacting, they can close the channel and settle the net result on the blockchain. This solution significantly reduces transaction costs and increases speed but is best suited for situations where participants need to transact many times with each other.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zero-Knowledge Rollups</strong></h3>



<p>Zero-knowledge rollups (zk-Rollups) are a type of Layer-2 solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to bundle multiple transactions into a single one. This solution provides security by storing transaction data on-chain while computation is performed off-chain. zk-Rollups offer a significant increase in transaction throughput and a reduction in gas fees. Moreover, they provide the same level of security as the underlying Layer-1 network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Optimistic Rollups</strong></h3>



<p>Optimistic Rollups are another form of Layer-2 scaling solution that leverages optimistic contracts on the Ethereum network. These rollups assume that all transactions are truthful and only require proof in case of disputes. By reducing the amount of computation required on-chain, Optimistic Rollups increase scalability and lower transaction fees.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Sidechains, Parachains</strong></h3>



<p>Sidechains are independent blockchains that run parallel to the main chain. They have their own consensus mechanisms and block validation processes, allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. Sidechains are interoperable with the main chain; assets can be transferred between the two via bridging mechanisms. However, the security of a sidechain depends on its own network and consensus, making it potentially less secure than the main chain.</p>



<p>The most widespread examples are:</p>



<ul><li>Polkadot parachains are independent and sovereign blockchains that operate in parallel to the main Polkadot network. They are designed to enhance scalability and interoperability within the Polkadot ecosystem. Parachains are connected to the Polkadot Relay Chain, which serves as the central hub for consensus and security.</li><li>Cosmos SDK Sub-Chains: in the context of the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem, sub-chains refer to independent blockchains created using the Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK). These sub-chains, also known as zones, are sovereign and can have their own consensus mechanisms, governance models, and token economics. Sub-chains in the Cosmos ecosystem provide scalability by allowing developers to build specialized blockchains that cater to specific use cases while benefiting from the overall security and interoperability offered by the Cosmos network.</li><li>Avalanche subnets refer to a feature implemented within the Avalanche blockchain platform. Subnets are dedicated segments or partitions within the Avalanche network that allow for parallel processing and handling of transactions. Each subnet can be assigned to a specific decentralized application (dApp), enabling efficient scalability by processing transactions in a highly parallelized manner.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Plasma</strong></h3>



<p>Plasma is a framework for building scalable applications where only a small portion of transactions are processed on the Ethereum mainnet. The rest are handled off-chain on child chains, each potentially having its own consensus mechanism. Plasma chains allow for high transaction throughput at low cost but are generally more complex to implement and require more active user involvement for securing assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the Best Layer 2 Solutions?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="675" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-10.png" alt="Some Layer 2 solutions stand out due to their effectiveness and wide adoption: Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet, zkEVM, and Gnosis Chain." class="wp-image-33291"/></figure>



<p>While many Layer-2 solutions are available, some stand out due to their effectiveness and wide adoption. These include Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet, zkEVM, Metis, and Gnosis Chain. Each of these solutions provides unique features that cater to different needs but all share a common goal: enhancing the scalability and efficiency of the underlying Layer-1 blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, Polygon offers a multi-chain system compatible with Ethereum, enabling fast and low-cost transactions. Similarly, Optimism provides an Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 solution, utilizing Optimistic Rollups to increase transaction speed and reduce costs.</p>



<p>Speaking about Bitcoin, a good example of L2 solution is Stacks. It provides a framework for developers to build smart contracts and dApps)on top of the secure and established Bitcoin network. By leveraging Stacks as an L2 solution, developers can enhance the scalability and throughput of their applications while maintaining the security and finality of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>



<p>In order to evaluate the best Layer-2 solutions, it&#8217;s important to compare different platforms based on a number of parameters. Let&#8217;s take a look at how Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Starknet, zkEVM, and Gnosis Chain stack up against each other:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Parameter / Platform</strong></td><td><strong>Polygon</strong></td><td><strong>Optimism</strong></td><td><strong>Arbitrum</strong></td><td><strong>Starknet</strong></td><td><strong>Metis</strong></td><td><strong>zkEVM</strong></td><td><strong>Gnosis Chain</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Solution Type</td><td>PoS sidechain</td><td>Optimistic Rollup</td><td>Optimistic Rollup</td><td>zk-Rollup</td><td>Optimistic Rollup</td><td>zk-Rollup</td><td>zk-Rollup</td></tr><tr><td>Transaction Speed</td><td>High</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Moderate</td><td>High</td><td>Moderate</td><td>High</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td>Security</td><td>Relies on own validators</td><td>Inherits Ethereum’s security</td><td>Inherits Ethereum’s security</td><td>Inherits Ethereum’s security</td><td>Inherits Ethereum’s security</td><td>Inherits Ethereum’s security</td><td>Inherits Ethereum’s security</td></tr><tr><td>Decentralization</td><td>Moderate</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Ease of Use</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>High</td><td>Moderate</td><td>High</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td>Fees</td><td>Low</td><td>Lower than Ethereum</td><td>Lower than Ethereum</td><td>Low</td><td>Lower than Ethereum</td><td>Low</td><td>Lower than Ethereum</td></tr><tr><td>Mainnet Launch</td><td>Live</td><td>Live</td><td>Live</td><td>Not yet live (as of 2023)</td><td>Live</td><td>Not yet live (as of 2023)</td><td>Live</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Each of these Layer-2 solutions has its own strengths and areas of focus, and the best solution for a particular use case depends on the specific requirements of that use case. For example, Polygon might be the best choice for a project that values speed and low fees, while Optimism or Arbitrum could be the preferred option for a project that places a high value on security and the benefits of optimistic rollups.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Future of L2 Blockchains</h2>



<p>The future of Layer-2 blockchain solutions is intertwined with the development and advancement of Layer-1 networks, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. As Layer-1 blockchains evolve and improve in scalability, Layer-2 solutions will also reap the benefits, inheriting all core features and improvements of their underlying Layer-1 blockchains.</p>



<p>Demand for blockchain technology is increasing rapidly, as is the total value locked (TVL) in Layer-2 solutions. As this trend continues, Layer-2 networks will become the de facto choice for users seeking to benefit from faster, cheaper transactions. Every day, new decentralized finance (DeFi) projects are being launched on Layer-2 blockchains, underlining their growing importance and relevance in the blockchain space.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the future of Layer-2 is not just about scalability and cost reduction. Privacy and security of users&#8217; data will also become central themes. Zero-knowledge networks, such as Starknet and zkEVM, are gaining popularity due to their ability to protect user data while still providing the benefits of blockchain transparency.</p>



<p>In these networks, transactions are verified without revealing any details about the transaction itself, thereby enhancing user privacy. This privacy feature is becoming more and more important as the issue of data protection continues to gain prominence in the digital world.</p>



<p>In conclusion, Layer-2 solutions will continue to evolve and adapt, driven by the increasing demand for scalable, secure, and privacy-preserving blockchain technology. As Layer-1 networks like Ethereum continue to grow and mature, so too will Layer-2 solutions, bringing us ever closer to the vision of a truly scalable, secure, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the ever-expanding universe of blockchain technologies, two giants have emerged, capturing not only the imagination of the crypto community but also billions of dollars in market value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sui and Aptos, each with their unique features and capabilities, have positioned themselves as game-changers in the blockchain arena.</p>



<p>As the global cryptocurrency market is <a href="https://ir.citi.com/gps/MG9DEWhoYvQJVWLM9Kr3%2BZmqjoztKJcyNHr83F9Wug2pzAGHPQKfp23RAMrkNts%2FJitXoTNqufOvegUjjXh0IA%3D%3D">projected to reach a staggering $4.94 trillion by 2030</a>, the competition between these two powerhouses has investors, developers, and enthusiasts on the edge of their seats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to choosing the right blockchain technology, a lot of features and factors must be considered.</p>



<p>In this article, we will explore the similarities and differences between Sui and Aptos&nbsp; blockchains, delving into various aspects such as programming language, consensus mechanism, architecture, security, privacy, ecosystem, scalability, tokenomics, and funding. By the end of this article, you will have a clearer understanding of which blockchain suits your needs best.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="600" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image.png" alt="Sui and Aptos, each with their unique features, have positioned themselves as game-changers in the crypto industry." class="wp-image-32917"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Similarities of Aptos and Sui</h2>



<p>Both Aptos and Sui blockchains are designed to address the scalability and efficiency issues faced by the current generation of blockchain networks. They both implement one of the most advanced programming languages &#8211; Move, utilize parallel execution for high throughput (TPS), and offer low latency. These similarities make them attractive options for businesses looking to build blockchain-based applications.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>Blaize has already considered the topic of choosing suitable blockchain technology for running your project. Feel free to discover our advice </strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-choose-the-right-blockchain-network-for-your-dapp-development/"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Aptos vs. Sui: Detailed Comparison</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Programming Language</strong></h3>



<p>The language used for parallel execution in both Aptos and Sui is Move, which is based on Rust and was initially designed at Meta. The language offers powerful tools and features to build smart contracts and decentralized applications. However, Sui has its own version of the language.</p>



<p>Aptos follows the standard design outlined in Diem&#8217;s whitepaper, while Sui has a slightly different object model. Sui&#8217;s storage system is object-centric, which means that most things on the blockchain, including addresses and transactions, are represented as objects.</p>



<p>Sui&#8217;s version of Move clearly indicates when an object is owned, shared, mutable, or immutable, whereas Aptos does not. Additionally, Sui&#8217;s ownership API is cleaner than Aptos&#8217;s, as it provides a clearer representation of the blockchain design.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Consensus Mechanism</strong></h3>



<p>Sui and Aptos have different architectures that affect how they use distributed ledger technology. Aptos uses a blockchain to record its ledger, while Sui&#8217;s distributed ledger is a directed acyclic graph. This impacts their consensus mechanisms and scalability.</p>



<p>Aptos utilizes a variant of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), which ensures high network security and fast transaction confirmations. Sui, on the other hand, employs a novel consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), which emphasizes energy efficiency and decentralization. Sui uses an asynchronous consensus protocol called Narwhal and Bullshark, which allows for parallel execution of transactions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="668" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1.png" alt="Aptos utilizes a variant of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), while Sui uses Proof of Space-Time (PoST)." class="wp-image-32918" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1.png 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1-1536x641.png 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1-1568x655.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Architecture</strong></h3>



<p>Sui and Aptos differ significantly in their architecture, particularly in how they utilize distributed ledger technology. Sui&#8217;s ledger is stored as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph (DAG)</a> rather than a blockchain like Aptos. While both designs are efficient and share similarities with traditional blockchains, their differences are essential to their consensus mechanism and scalability.</p>



<p>Aptos has a modular architecture that enables easy upgrades and customizations, while Sui focuses on a multi-layered architecture to separate the consensus, storage, and computation layers. This allows for improved scalability and flexibility in the network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security and Privacy</strong></h3>



<p>While it is true that Aptos and Sui have not undergone a formal audit, this does not necessarily mean that they are not secure or reliable. Many blockchain projects have been successfully launched without formal audits, and smaller projects are not uncommon to prioritize other aspects of development before seeking formal auditing.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that potential vulnerabilities or flaws in the code may not be identified without a formal audit. It&#8217;s also worth noting that the lack of a formal audit could be a cause for concern for some investors and users who prioritize security and transparency. At Blaize, we provide deep security audit services for blockchains (nodes and consensus).</p>



<p>While Move programming language offers a significant level of security by its design, it doesn’t make contracts secure by default. Secure contract development includes using modern language features while crafting the code and secure and reliable architectural design of the contract with obligatory <a href="https://blaize.tech/security/">smart contract security audit</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ecosystem</strong></h3>



<p>The ecosystems are very different and extensive in both projects. Every day there is something new to discover at both chains. It&#8217;s hard to pick out an outsider and a favorite. Aptos blockchain got its popularity before Sui, but at the moment, judging by the number of followers on Discord, Sui is overtaking Aptos.</p>



<p>After a surge in the popularity of Aptos several months ago, many various projects were created and launched exactly using that blockchain. During the year 2022, over 100 projects were developed using Aptos network.</p>



<p>The most popular projects built over Aptos include <a href="https://pontem.network/">Pontem</a> (a universal wallet) and <a href="https://pyth.network/">Pyth</a> (a modern oracle).</p>



<p>Aptos boasts a growing ecosystem of tools, libraries, and developer resources, while Sui&#8217;s ecosystem is relatively nascent but has the potential to grow rapidly as more developers join the network.</p>



<p>As for Sui, the mainnet of the network will only be launched in Q2 2023 and the testnet was launched in the last days of March 2023. Thus, the majority of the project is now TBA. One of the most remarkable Sui projects so far is Sui wallet. Still, the Sui blockchain has great potential to overtake Aptos due to its scalability level.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scalability</strong></h3>



<p>Aptos and Sui both focus on achieving high scalability through parallel execution, sharding, and other techniques, aiming to support millions of transactions per second.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a centralized validator or pursuing large-scale decentralization, both Sui and Aptos prioritize optimizing scalability by maximizing network capacity, similar to the approach taken by Solana. However, the bottleneck in achieving this goal is likely to be the growth of the ecosystem&#8217;s state.</p>



<p>To address this bottleneck, Aptos prioritizes using heterogeneous validators with constrained CPU and storage resources, while Sui plans to efficiently shard data storage and scale its resources horizontally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h3>



<p>Aptos and Sui are two blockchain ecosystems with different approaches to their tokenomics. Aptos has released an overview of their tokenomics for their native token APT, but additional information is expected to be published soon. APT is currently used for PoS participation and liquidity incentives, with an initial supply of 1 billion tokens. The majority of the initial supply is currently staked for PoS participation, with the remaining tokens allocated to different categories.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Mysten Labs has published an in-depth whitepaper on the native token of Sui, SUI. SUI will be staked within an epoch to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism and on-chain voting. Additionally, SUI will be used as the asset denomination to pay for gas fees and other operations on the Sui platform, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens. The exact allocation percentages for the distribution of tokens have not been released, but the presence of the storage fund can create monetary dynamics and reduce the amount of SUI in circulation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Funding</strong></h3>



<p>Aptos Labs has amassed a total of about $400 million in funding from a wide array of capital ventures, including Andreessen Horowitz, FTX Ventures, Jump Crypto, a16z, Tiger Global, and Multicoin Capital, among others. At present, Aptos Labs counts 28 investors among its backers.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Sui is making significant strides with its latest funding round, the Series B, which took place in September 2022. The company behind Sui, Mysten Labs, has received significant support from major investors, such as Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, and Redpoint and managed to secure $300 million in this funding round, bringing Sui&#8217;s total funding to $36 million when combined with the $336 million raised in the Series A. Sui has also announced that it currently holds a valuation of over $2 billion.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h3>



<p>An essential feature of P2E games is a well-designed tokenomics model that governs the game&#8217;s native tokens or game currency. This includes token distribution, utility, and mechanisms for earning, spending, and staking tokens within the game. A successful tokenomics model should incentivize players to participate in the game and contribute to its ecosystem while maintaining a healthy in-game economy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Micro Payments</strong></h3>



<p>To facilitate seamless in-game transactions, P2E games should support micro payments, allowing players to make small, frequent transactions without incurring high fees. This enables players to easily trade and sell their in-game assets, enhancing the overall gaming experience and fostering a thriving in-game economy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In-Game Currency</strong></h3>



<p>A crucial component of P2E games is the implementation of an in-game currency that can be earned, traded, and spent within the game ecosystem. This currency should have real-world value, enabling players to monetize their gaming efforts and providing a tangible incentive to participate in the game. In many P2E games, in-game currency takes the form of tokens, bonds or other cryptoassets built on blockchain platforms.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Player-Owned Assets and NFTs</strong></h3>



<p>P2E games should incorporate player-owned assets, often represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), to empower players with true ownership and control over their in-game items, characters, and other digital assets. NFTs, which are unique and indivisible, enable players to trade, sell, or use their assets within the game ecosystem, fostering a vibrant and dynamic in-game economy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">P2E Game Architecture</h2>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>NFT platform development has become a hot topic in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, as more and more projects seek to implement NFT into their businesses.</p>



<p>The NFT market has gone through a hard journey in the past three years. 2021 witnessed an explosive eruption, reaching an estimated total sales volume of $41 billion. This surge was fueled by excitement surrounding digital art, collectibles, and the burgeoning play-to-earn gaming sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following year witnessed a continuation of this boom, with the market surpassing a staggering $100 billion fueled by sustained hype and diversification into previously untapped domains like music, sports, and metaverse projects.</p>



<p>However, after scaling such heights of popularity and value, the NFT market encountered a decline. The year 2023 ushered in a sharp correction, with sales volume plummeting to approximately $25 billion. This downturn can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including broader macroeconomic challenges and a sense of market saturation that dampened initial enthusiasm. As a result, concerns regarding the long-term sustainability and future of NFT art proliferated. Despite these apprehensions, key industry players remain optimistic, actively contemplating and even anticipating a market rebirth.</p>



<p>That is why developing an NFT platform in 2024 is a perfect idea – the enduring relevance of NFTs extends beyond the current year: NFTs present new utility opportunities besides just objects of art. Indeed, 2024 presents a great moment for the development of innovative NFT platforms.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-00850f0fc854a9a880165af6f96996bb">Here at Blaize, we’ve been working with NFTs for years, developing custom solutions for <a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/"><strong>world-known clients</strong></a>. We have <strong>successfully launched several NFT projects</strong> and released numerous collections that were quickly recognized by the general public.</p>



<p>But today, we won’t be deploying anything – our main goal is to share experience and guide you through the exciting NFT platform development. Let’s take a closer look at the intricacies of the process of developing an NFT platform.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HOW TO CREATE AN NFT PLATFORM IN 10 STEPS</h2>



<p>1.<strong>Define the concept of your platform:</strong></p>



<p>Clearly define the purpose, target audience, core functionalities of your platform and revenue-generating opportunities. Who are you trying to serve? What unique experience will you offer? Imagine your ideal user and tailor the platform experience to their specific needs and preferences.</p>



<p>2.<strong>Gather a reliable and experienced team:</strong></p>



<p>Building a successful platform requires a skilled and experienced team. Hire developers with expertise in blockchain technology and NFT development, alongside talented designers, marketing professionals, and anyone else crucial to your vision. Prioritize individuals with a proven track record in relevant fields.</p>



<p>3.<strong>Take care of the technical development:</strong></p>



<p>Choosing the right blockchain is paramount. Consider factors like users engagement, ecosystem, and liquidity. There’re several options which offer ready to work infrastructure solutions. Develop secure smart contracts to govern core functionalities and seamlessly integrate them with your chosen blockchain. Ensure your platform adheres to industry standards and best securitypractices.</p>



<p>4.<strong>Select and connect all the necessary infrastructure, including the chosen metadata storage provider:</strong></p>



<p>Select and connect reliable 3rd-parties that seamlessly integrate with popular NFT marketplaces, wallets, and metadata storage providers. Prioritize reliability, security, and SDKs that align seamlessly with your platform&#8217;s overall architecture and functionalities.</p>



<p>5.<strong>Work on the UI/UX design:</strong></p>



<p>Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes navigating and interacting with your platform a joy. Prioritize visual appeal, accessibility, and a smooth user journey. Remember, first impressions matter – make sure your design is both beautiful and functional.</p>



<p>6.<strong>Complete the front-end part of the product development:</strong></p>



<p>Translate your stunning UI/UX design into a functional and responsive front-end application. Optimize performance for speed and ensure cross-browser compatibility to reach a wider audience. Meticulously craft every pixel to deliver an exceptional user experience on any device.</p>



<p>7.<strong>Prioritize a comprehensive smart contract security audit before public release:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Similar to testing of any final product, meticulously examining your platform&#8217;s smart contracts for vulnerabilities and potential exploits is crucial. Enlist qualified security professionals like <a href="https://blaize.tech/">Blaize</a> to conduct this audit. By proactively addressing identified vulnerabilities, you significantly mitigate financial losses, reputational damage, and foster additional trust among your users.</p>



<p>8.<strong>Test the final product before public release:</strong></p>



<p>Before unleashing your platform to the world, put it through rigorous testing. Conduct thorough functionality, security, and user experience tests across various devices and scenarios. Consider involving potential users in beta testing to gather valuable feedback and identify areas for improvement.</p>



<p>9.<strong>Deploy the platform and launch it in the market:</strong></p>



<p>Deploy your platform on the chosen infrastructure and <a href="https://blaize.tech/services/blockchain-marketing/marketing-for-blockchain-projects-a-comprehensive-guide/">initiate a strategic marketing campaign</a>. Build community engagement, attract early adopters, and generate media coverage to create buzz and excitement. Remember, a successful launch is just the beginning.</p>



<p>10.<strong>Provide continuous support and maintenance:</strong></p>



<p>The whole process doesn&#8217;t end with launch. Continuously provide technical support, address user feedback, and implement platform updates to ensure its long-term success. Don’t forget to carry on security audits on a regular basis. Stay adaptable to evolving industry trends and user needs to keep your platform at the forefront of the NFT market.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Decide on The Type of Your NFT Platform</h2>



<p>The first crucial step is selecting the platform that aligns with your vision. Remember, an NFT platform isn&#8217;t solely a marketplace &#8211; it&#8217;s your launchpad for diverse possibilities. Let&#8217;s explore various platform types to aid your informed decision:</p>



<p>1. Marketplaces: These familiar platforms facilitate buying, selling, and trading NFTs. They excel at connecting creators and collectors, providing exposure and liquidity. Ideal for established creators with ready-to-sell collections or projects focused on tradable assets.</p>



<p>2. Minting Platforms: Focus on creating and launching NFT collections. They offer tools for minting, setting smart contracts, and managing drops. Well-suited for artists, startups, or projects with unique collections needing tailored minting solutions.</p>



<p>3. Tokenization Platforms: These delve deeper, tokenizing real-world assets (e.g., real estate, artwork) into NFTs (think security token offerings or fractional ownership platforms). They bridge the gap between traditional and digital assets, unlocking new investment and ownership opportunities. Consider this if your project involves tokenizing tangible assets or creating unique ownership structures.</p>



<p>4. Gaming Platforms: Integrate NFTs into the gaming experience. These platforms enable in-game item ownership, character creation, and even play-to-earn mechanics. Perfect for projects aiming to build NFT-powered games or metaverses where users interact and derive value through NFTs.</p>



<p>We’ll describe the major types of NFT platforms below so that you can assess your needs and make a well-grounded decision.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT MARKETPLACE</strong></h3>



<p>The first option we’d like to mention is a universal trading platform for non-fungible assets. By creating your own NFT marketplace platform, you make NFTs a bit more available to a wider audience and, thus, speed up their global adoption.</p>



<p>Currently, there are a few popular websites for such purposes, so if you’d like to build an NFT marketplace platform, you’d better do thorough research before you kick into gear.</p>



<p>Here are just a few honorable mentions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Blur </strong>– currently the biggest NFT marketplace, a rising star for professional traders, offering low fees, fast interface, and innovative features like fee-less bidding. Targets high-volume traders with advanced portfolio management tools.</li>



<li><strong>OpenSea</strong> – is the world’s first web3 marketplace for NFTs and crypto collectibles. It enables creating and trading NFTs, starting auctions, and browsing digital art for inspiration.</li>



<li><strong>Element Market</strong> – focuses on curated experiences and community. Offers a selective, high-quality collection of NFTs and fosters connections between collectors and creators through events and dedicated channels. Caters to collectors seeking unique pieces and a vibrant community.</li>



<li><strong>Rarible </strong>– a multichain community-centric NFT marketplace that is known for low fees for NFT creators.</li>
</ul>



<p>Most NFT marketplaces allow users to mint and trade different types of non-interchangeable tokens on Ethereum, BNB Chain, or other blockchains. In return for their services, marketplaces get a commission, which is the foundation of their revenue.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-d2c4d5c8946cc94b8cd1acd10a5e3828">By the way, hiring a professional <a href="https://blaize.tech/token-development-services/"><strong>web3 development company</strong></a> can help ensure a successful launch of your NFT marketplace platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/crypto-art-explained/">Read More about the NFT art marketplaces and the tendencies of its development</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT COLLECTION</strong></h3>



<p>The digital art is still one of the most common NFT utilities no matter whether it’s the initial generation of monsters for a new game, the initial balance of shares from a tokenized villa, or even a preliminary art collection to raise money for further development of your platform.</p>



<p>The pros of NFT collections include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Relatively simple development process as you won’t actually need to build an NFT platform – you can easily mint your NFTs on one of the existing marketplaces.</li>



<li>The possibility to receive quick profit if you have a strong community or market your collection well.</li>



<li>Plenty of choices when it comes to NFT utility – your collection can consist of digital art, music, AR/VR items, real-world objects, metaverse real estate, and much more.</li>
</ul>



<p>Even though NFT collections don’t require separate platforms, you can still create one for your company. Yet, in this case, the whole NFT platform development would take much more time and resources.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT GAMING SOLUTION</strong></h3>



<p>The GameFi segment is another major type of NFT platforms. Blockchain games with NFT rewards and in-game objects have been on the rise regardless of the overall market decline. And we are sure this will remain so.</p>



<p>According to the research held at the beginning of 2022, some NFT games <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1266486/blockchain-games-user-number/"><strong>attracted up to 1.1 million unique users</strong></a> monthly, which is an incredible number for a rather niche product.</p>



<p>And the best part about gamefi is that you don’t need to limit your imagination. While standard NFT platforms, such as marketplaces, offer similar functions, games are definitely not meant to put you in the box.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, you should keep in mind that NFT gaming platform development requires much more dedication and resources than many other types of NFT utility. On top of blockchain development expertise, your team must have experience working with game mechanics, creating engaging plots, and designing characters.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT IN DEFI</strong></h3>



<p>Decentralized finance also provides a vast field for NFT application. However, NFT utility here is much less evident than when it comes to gaming or marketplaces, so let us guide you through it.</p>



<p>First, NFTs might serve as liquidity provider (LP) position representation, similar to the Uniswap V3 solution. Based on the pool and the selected parameters, users will receive a unique NFT representing their position in that specific pool.</p>



<p>Second, there is a separate niche of NFT lending that allows for collateralizing users’ NFTs as a loan in exchange for immediate crypto payment.</p>



<p>Third, we have various financial instruments inherited from traditional finance and transformed into DeFi NFT-based solutions. These are NFT bonds, options, and different derivatives in the form of NFTs.</p>



<p>NFTs can have many other DeFi utilities, like serving as a yield farming boost, so we’ll leave the rest to your imagination and business needs.</p>



<p>Did you know that by using the power of <a href="https://blaize.tech/for-enterprises/"><strong>enterprise blockchain</strong></a>, businesses can unlock new revenue streams, reduce costs, and streamline operations? So why not explore the full potential of enterprise blockchain and NFTs for your business today?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">NFT AS A KEY TO SMART ACCOUNTS</h2>



<p>Beyond their current application as static assets, NFTs are poised to unlock a new dimension of user interaction – serving as the keys to smart accounts enabled by the ERC-6551 standard. This transformative integration elevates NFTs from ownership tokens into personalized passports to a secure, on-chain identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine an NFT not simply representing digital ownership, but acting as the exclusive key to a smart contract wallet – your gateway to interacting with DeFi protocols, managing digital assets, and executing complex financial transactions, all without the traditional vulnerabilities of custodial wallets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">NFT PLATFORM COMPONENTS</h2>



<p>NFT platforms exhibit diverse specializations, including marketplaces, tokenization platforms, RWA protocols, simple minting pages, and sophisticated digital art auctions. Despite their distinct functionalities, these platforms share many common components and necessitate a comprehensive development approach involving a team of professionals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="900" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_6-_3_.webp" alt="NFT platforms exhibit diverse specializations, including marketplaces, tokenization platforms, RWA protocols, simple minting pages, and sophisticated digital art auctions." class="wp-image-53719" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_6-_3_.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_6-_3_-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_6-_3_-1568x882.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p class="has-dark-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-02470407ea245289a534e5c690ad7bb1"><strong>Smart Contracts at the Core</strong>: Smart contracts are fundamental in decentralizing protocols, with NFTs being a primary application. Platforms typically require standards such as ERC721, ERC1155, or newer ones like ERC-5956 and ERC-6220. Their implementations are often straightforward, thanks to libraries like OpenZeppelin and ERC721A, which provide fully audited contracts with essential plugins. While other chains have unique NFT standards, most adhere to traditional EVM standards, facilitating development across various platforms including Solana and Sui.<br>However, there are a few points that require additional attention:</p>



<ul>
<li>Royalty: This may involve ERC-2981 or other formats agreed upon by the marketplace and demands high attention from the security team.</li>



<li>Minting Process: Airdrops, batch mints, auctions, and sales usually incorporate custom logic, necessitating an experienced team to adapt proven concepts to the protocol&#8217;s needs.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Metadata and Storage</strong>: A crucial element of any NFT platform is the metadata associated with NFTs, including the infrastructure for its storage, which involves SDKs and gateways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For storage, there are many reliable solutions like Moralis, Alchemy, Arweave, and Filecoin, offering both storage and tools for efficient metadata management. Integration into the project&#8217;s pipeline is essential. While working with pure IPFS might not be necessary, automating metadata formatting, optimizing the NFT minting process, and connecting storage SDK endpoints with your dApp and backend services are crucial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blaize manages all integration processes and additional development for rapid metadata management for thousands of NFTs, handling metadata updates for flippers and metaverse projects, or uploading digital certificates for RWA protocols.</p>



<p><strong>dApp and UI</strong>: The purpose of your NFT platform might vary, but essential components include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Explorer Functionality: To view assets or browse existing collections.</li>



<li>Basic Transfer, Minting, and Sale Interfaces: Allowing users to interact with NFTs on your platform.</li>



<li>Integrated Wallets: Such as MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase wallet, or specific chain wallets like Phantom and Solflare for Solana, or Martian and SuiWallet for Sui.</li>
</ul>



<p>Frontend and web3 engineers are required to build the dApp with all necessary functionality. Additionally, UI/UX design, covered by our in-house designers, is crucial for an engaging user experience.</p>



<p><strong>Offchain Services</strong>: Despite their decentralized nature, every dApp requires backend services. NFT platforms are no exception, necessitating services for aggregating and indexing on-chain information, bootstrapping and caching metadata, providing reliable price feeds, and maintaining databases for prices, transaction histories, and user accounts. Even a small NFT minting page will need integration with tools like Subgraph, Airstack, or Moralis SDK, enabling functionalities like displaying all NFT owners and sales history. A backend engineer is thus an indispensable part of the team.</p>



<p><strong>Even More Smart Contracts</strong>: Depending on the platform type, additional functionality often requires the development of more smart contracts, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrades and Wraps for NFTs</strong></li>



<li><strong>Various Auctions, Drops, and Sale Types</strong></li>



<li><strong>NFT Locks, Staking, Depositing as Collateral</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tokenization Pipelines and Vaults for NFT Fractioning</strong></li>



<li><strong>Custom Solutions or Protocol Integrations as Needed by the Platform</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Blaize is well-equipped with a team of specialists covering all necessary development areas, ensuring comprehensive and effective NFT platform development. This way, you will be sure that the project is done according to industry best practices and that the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/web3-security/best-practices-for-secure-nft-development/">final product is reliable and secure</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>NFT MARKETPLACE FEATURES FOR DIFFERENT PARTIES</strong></h3>



<p>Let’s say you decided to create an NFT platform<strong> </strong>for trading assets. What should you start with, and which functionality should you include?</p>



<p>If you’re wondering how to develop your own NFT marketplace, one of the most important things to consider is business logic. The underlying smart contracts must work impeccably so that none of the involved parties could get deceived or feel uncomfortable while using your product.</p>



<p>We’ll describe the key functionality for different categories of users, including buyers, sellers, and administrators. Make sure to develop a solution that considers all of these points, and don’t hesitate to add custom features that would be unique to your project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many investors and businesses looking to create their own digital currencies. With all the traders, P2E players, investors, and convinced holders, there are currently <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/cryptocurrency-statistics/">over 300 million crypto users</a> worldwide. This is the biggest number of crypto owners the world has ever seen.</p>



<p>In this article, we provide a comprehensive guide on how to create a cryptocurrency, covering everything from the initial concept to the deployment of the finished product. Whether you are a developer or an entrepreneur, this guide will provide valuable insights into the process of creating your own cryptocurrency.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">As a company that’s been <a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/">developing blockchains, dApps, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies</a> for over 5 years, we can share tips and hints our engineers use on a daily basis. This way, you’ll be able to facilitate the development process and create an efficient solution faster. And if you need any help along the way, feel free to <a href="https://blaize.tech/#contacts">contact us</a> to get a consultation or hire outsourced blockchain developers for your project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5 Benefits of Launching Your Own Cryptocurrency</h2>



<p>Before talking about how to make my own cryptocurrency, let’s deal with all the <em>why’s</em>.</p>



<p>When it comes to crypto assets, most companies and bloggers share the information for retail investors, trying to attract a wider audience. However, almost no one talks about the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/opinion/top-10-blockchain-development-companies-for-2023/">companies </a>creating a cryptocurrency and the benefits they get.</p>



<p>So what is it about developing a cryptocurrency for your business or brand? What are the advantages of this decision, and what to expect overall?</p>



<p><strong>P.S.: If you’d like to skip to the part on </strong><strong>how to create a cryptocurrency</strong><strong>, scroll through a few chapters until you see the </strong><strong><em>Ways to Create a Cryptocurrency</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>There are plenty of benefits to making your own crypto. Here are just a few of them:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced data security.</strong> With the help of blockchain technology, you can significantly improve the security of user’s funds and data, allowing them to enjoy safe trading and <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/defi-security-how-to-prevent-your-defi-project-from-hacking/">mitigating the risk of hacker attacks and fraud</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Low operational costs.</strong> With decentralized networks, there is no need for pricey third-party services or middlemen, which means that you’ll be able to cut costs.</li>



<li><strong>High-speed transactions. </strong>Blockchain enables near-instant transactions and zero amount of paperwork, helping you perform operations in just a few moments.</li>



<li><strong>Anonymity, yet transparency. </strong>If you strive for anonymous transactions, crypto is your number-one choice. And yet, all the operations performed on the chain can be tracked due to its decentralized nature, allowing for great transparency and trustless service.</li>



<li><strong>New audience.</strong> Creating your own cryptocurrency will grant you access to the whole community of blockchain enthusiasts, thus, enlarging your target audience pool and bringing in new customers.</li>
</ul>



<p>As you see, deploying your own crypto is highly beneficial on many levels. But the critical part is to do it correctly to ensure <a href="https://blaize.tech/services/how-to-boost-smart-contract-security-and-mitigate-risks-in-defi/">high security</a> and top up with proper marketing so that your project achieves the ultimate goal.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Is The Difference Between Crypto Coins And Tokens?</h2>



<p>If you are just starting your journey in the crypto industry and want to figure out how to create your own digital currency, there are quite a few questions you might be asking. But one of the basic things to cover first is the difference between two notions: coins and tokens.</p>



<p>Simply put, a coin is a native blockchain-specific asset that is distributed among miners or validators. A token, on the other hand, is a secondary notion that is secured by smart contracts and has a specific utility or security function.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">We have discussed this difference in more detail and provided some examples in one of our previous articles, so make sure to <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/tokenomics-for-crypto-games-how-to-develop-economy-for-gamefi/">check it out to learn more</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Comparing the Development of Crypto Coins and Tokens</h2>



<p>When you decide to build your own cryptocurrency, all the technical details start coming to the foreground. And one of the first tech dilemmas you’ll have to face will be whether you should develop a coin or a token. By the way, the Blaze team also specializes in <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/nft-development-services/">NFT development</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Since you already know the basic difference between the two, let’s dive into the details. <em>(What? Don’t you know the difference? Then get back to the previous chapter and stop skipping essential parts ;))</em></p>



<p>The important thing about crypto coins and tokens is the way they are made. While tokens are created on the foundation of an existing blockchain, coins require developing a new one. Of course, this takes much more time and human resources, so make sure you’ve weighed all pros and cons before making this decision. </p>

<p>To make your cryptocurrency development a bit easier and speed up the decision-making process, we’ve come up with this comparative table:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Coin</strong></td><td><strong>Token</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Requires a dedicated blockchain network</td><td>Can be built on existing blockchains with smart contracts</td></tr><tr><td>Requires a certain consensus – emission rules that are established in the blockchain</td><td>The emission is determined by the creator</td></tr><tr><td>Needs economic balance for emission and distribution</td><td>Requires well-balanced tokenomics</td></tr><tr><td>Required additional expenses in case of bridging on other chains</td><td>Can be bridged on the existing solutions</td></tr><tr><td>Has to be developed impeccably since it will be powering the whole ecosystem</td><td>Lives within the protocol, which means it has to bring some value and utility to the protocol</td></tr><tr><td>Needs an experienced team with in-depth blockchain knowledge&nbsp;</td><td>Requires the team with previous experience in developing smart contracts</td></tr><tr><td>Due to the necessary blockchain development, takes more time and requires better funding</td><td>Is much easier, faster, and relatively cheap, which is a key factor for many startup teams</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>By the way, we provide <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/for-startups/">blockchain development for startups</a></strong>, so if you have additional questions, please ask.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ways to Create a Cryptocurrency</h2>



<p>Depending on the type of asset you’ve set your mind on in the previous step, there might be different ways to create a cryptocurrency. All of them have their pros and cons, which we’ll describe below.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Create a New Blockchain</h3>



<p>As we have mentioned before, developing a new blockchain to create your own crypto coin is one of the most difficult, expensive, and time-consuming solutions. This will require you to hire an experienced team of blockchain developers with specific industry knowledge and spend a lot on the tech stack.</p>



<p>Another issue with this method is the necessity to attract an audience to a newly created blockchain, which might be a major challenge in the current market.</p>



<p>And yet, new blockchain creation comes with certain benefits that experienced developers can appreciate. For instance, you can implement new principles or a whole new ecosystem on the chain.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Fork an Existing Blockchain</h3>



<p>If you are sure that your business needs a coin, but you have a limited budget and don’t want to hire too many specialists, this is a solution for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of creating your own blockchain, consider <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/which-blockchain-to-fork-to-start-your-own-cryptocurrency/">forking an existing one</a>. This way, you will be able to cut costs and save time since all that your team will have to do is alter the source code of an existing network and launch your new coin.</p>



<p>However, be aware that forking an existing blockchain may lead to potential security issues or increased market volatility as traders adjust to the creation of the new cryptocurrency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Use an Existing Cryptocurrency Creation Platform</h3>



<p>This is by far the easiest way to create a cryptocurrency token and the most cost-efficient one. Using an existing platform with a ready-made set of <a href="https://blaize.tech/developer-tools/">developer tools</a> will allow your team to develop and launch a token fast and with no extra headache. And still, you would need to hire knowledgeable developers with experience in <a href="https://blaize.tech/smart-contracts/">working with smart contracts to build a secure solution</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Solutions for Creating Your Own Crypto Tokens &amp; Coins</h2>



<p>Since creating a token on the existing platform is one of the easiest and most cost-efficient solutions, let’s talk about it in detail.</p>



<p>Currently, there are a few blockchains and ecosystems that allow for developing new tokens and even provide suitable tools for that. The most popular and stable ones are EVMs and NEAR.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">As a <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/token-development-services/">token development company</a></strong>, our team has expertise in creating tokens on popular platforms like EVMs and NEAR. We can guide you through the entire process and provide the necessary tools for a seamless token creation experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. ERC20</h3>



<p>Ethereum was the first chain to offer custom token creation. Later, many EVM chains were developed on its basis, which also allowed developers to deploy their own ERC20 tokens. Such chains include Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Tron, Fantom, and many more.</p>



<p>ERC20 tokens are the most popular in the current market and bring a few benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li>Easy and fast development</li>



<li>Cost-effectiveness</li>



<li>Easy usage and adoption by a wider audience</li>



<li>Quick fundraising</li>



<li>Versatility</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Programming language: Solidity.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. NEP20</h3>



<p>Another popular option is deploying a NEP20 token in the NEAR ecosystem. Even though this chain is not as old as Ethereum, it has gained an impressive reputation over the years and attracted a huge community of supporters.</p>



<p><strong>Programming language: Rust.</strong></p>



<p>On top of the token creation through different platforms, you can create your own coin in a few ways that are a bit easier than others.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Fork Bitcoin</h3>



<p>One of the easiest ways to develop a crypto coin is by forking. You can fork any chain from the Bitcoin family, including Bitcoin itself, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Dash, and so on. However, as we have mentioned before, it would still require you a lot more time and funding than making a cryptocurrency on existing platforms.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Substrate chain or Polkadot parachain</h3>



<p>One more popular but rather long way to create a cryptocurrency token is in the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/">Polkadot network</a>. The ecosystem offers a unique concept of parachains, application-specific chains that enable building whatever protocol you want with almost no limitations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to Consider When Building Your Own Cryptocurrency</h2>



<p>When working on the project, many teams focus on how to create a cryptocurrency in terms of the technical solution. However, you should never forget about the business component of launching your own token or coin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is why we are sure that one of the most crucial things to consider when you start a project is the utility of your cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The utility is the first thing that any potential investor will pay attention to when opening your website or a Whitepaper, so make sure to take it seriously. To begin with, answer the questions, <strong>“<em>What’s the purpose of our crypto? What services does it give access to?”</em></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Make Your Own Cryptocurrency in 7 Steps</h2>



<p>So how to make a cryptocurrency that will remain secure and attract new users? It is a complex process that includes not just the development part but also many business decisions.</p>



<p>We have compiled an overall step-by-step guide on how to start your own cryptocurrency. Hope you will find it useful.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Define your business idea</strong></h3>



<p>As we have stated before, defining your business concept and key ideas must be the first step of any project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure to think through your business case and decide whether you need a token at all. You’ll be surprised to find out how many companies have launched their own crypto even though there were much easier options to cover their business goals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Define token utility</strong></h3>



<p>Next, to create your own cryptocurrency, you need to know who will use it and how they will apply it. So your task is to decide on what kind of token you need to make – a security or a utility one – and what exact application of the token you can offer.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Plan your future listings</strong></h3>



<p>Make sure to plan (or at least draft) your future listings early in the project, even before the development stage. This will help you understand all the possible requirements and regulations that your future cryptocurrency has to comply with.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Choose a blockchain platform&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Finally, it’s time to choose the platform where you will make a new cryptocurrency launch, whether it’s gonna be yours or an already existing one. Again, you should take it pretty seriously since it will influence token adoption, community growth, and many other factors. In the future, when starting your own cryptocurrency, this will affect its success.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Development</strong></h3>



<p>This one is self-explanatory, right? It’s time to get head over heels in code and work on that crypto. Make sure to gather an expert team with extensive experience in blockchain development to achieve the best results.</p>



<p>If you’d like to save time engaging separate experts, consider hiring an outsourced blockchain development team.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background"><a href="https://blaize.tech/">Blaize</a> developers have over 5 years of experience working with leading blockchain products in the market. We’ve successfully completed 70+ projects and deployed over 400 smart contracts for your clients. <a href="https://blaize.tech/#contacts">Contact our team</a> to get a custom solution according to your requirements or read our guide on <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-build-a-successful-defi-project/">how to build a DeFi project</a></strong> for better understanding.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Audits &amp; legal check</strong></h3>



<p>An essential part of post-development teamwork is conducting audits and double-checking all legal aspects.</p>



<p>We recommend you hire a couple of reputable <a href="https://blaize.tech/security/">smart contract auditing firm</a> to ensure the high security of your protocol and eliminate any <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/9-most-common-smart-contract-vulnerabilities-found-by-blaize/">possible vulnerabilities of smart contracts</a>. Without this, making your own cryptocurrency becomes more complicated by several dozen times.</p>



<p>Discover the <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/smart-contracts-with-blockchain-how-it-can-help-startups-be-more-cost-efficient/">benefits of smart contacts</a> </strong>and find out how it affects different business sectors.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Start the emission</strong></h3>



<p>Finally, it’s time to create a new cryptocurrency for your business by minting it in the chosen <a href="https://blaize.tech/blockchain-ecosystems/">ecosystem</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have reached this point, congrats, you did a great job! Yet, don’t think that your journey is over – there’s still a lot of marketing and community work ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides, you’ll need to keep all the promises you made in the Whitepaper during your promo campaign. But this is a whole different story.</p>

<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and blockchain, entrepreneurs and businesses continue to explore new ways to fund their ventures, and one of the most popular methods is to launch their own ICO. If you think that the ICO Epocha is long gone, you’ll be surprised to find out how many companies have launched ICOs since their “golden era.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021 alone, 136 projects raised over $1.3 trillion this way. Not bad, huh?</p>



<p>And now, in 2023, ICO, STO, and IEO fundraisings are still pretty common among blockchain projects. Moreover, we expect them to get even more popular as the recession period comes to an end.</p>



<p>That’s why today, <strong>we’ll share some tips and hints on choosing the most suitable type of </strong><strong>fundraising</strong><strong> for your product and conducting a successful launch.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">Here at Blaize, we’ve been dealing with different blockchain projects for over 5 years, working on their tech stack development and consulting on the best solutions for enhanced protocol security and demand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are sure that by the time you finish reading this article, you’ll have a much better understanding of how to launch an ICO, STO, and IEO and will be able to choose the best-fitting option for your project. Are you ready to start?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">ICO, STO, IEO: Brief Overview</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic3-1.jpg" alt="How to start ICO, STO, or IEO" class="wp-image-9094" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic3-1.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic3-1-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic3-1-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>So what’s the difference between launching an ICO, IEO, or STO? Let&#8217;s consider IEO vs. ICO, and other types.</p>



<p>An <strong>ICO stands for Initial Coin </strong><strong>Offering</strong>, the type of blockchain-based crowdfunding that was booming in 2016-2018. It was one of the first methods of fundraising that emerged in the crypto industry and quickly gained popularity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launching an ICO allows <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/opinion/top-10-blockchain-development-companies-for-2023/">companies</a> to raise capital for product development, while users can get early access to the project’s utility tokens, suggesting that they will rise in value.</p>



<p>An <strong>IEO, aka Initial </strong><strong>Exchange</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Offering,</strong> is another type of fundraising that is managed by an exchange platform, unlike ICOs that are fully managed by the internal project team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to their nature, IEOs are usually easier to access and trust by the general public.</p>



<p>An <strong>STO, or </strong><strong>Security</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Token</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Offering</strong>, is a public sale of security tokens on a crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In contrast to ICOs and IEOs, which only offer utility tokens, STOs are specifically created for selling tokenized securities. Such a form of fundraising usually gains much more trust than any other crowdfunding and, thus, leads to better outcomes. However, it is significantly harder to launch, too, due to strict regulations volved in launching an STO requires the assistance of experienced <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/token-development-services/">crypto token developers</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Here is a more elaborate table on the launch of an ICO, IEO, or STO for you to get a better grasp of all the differences.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Initial Coin </strong><strong>Offering</strong><strong> (ICO)</strong></td><td><strong>Initial </strong><strong>Exchange</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Offering</strong><strong> (IEO)</strong></td><td><strong>Security</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Token</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Offering</strong><strong> (STO)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Investor participation</td><td>Global participation, low entry barriers (fractional ownership of tokens)</td><td>Potential global participation, depending on the exchange governance, reach, and user base</td><td>Large participation possible, low entry barriers (fractional ownership)</td></tr><tr><td>Capital formation process</td><td>High cost efficiency (because of the automated process)</td><td>Cost efficient and scalable as the exchange can leverage established investor relationships and data</td><td>Beneficial cost efficiency VS traditional security issuance</td></tr><tr><td>Regulation</td><td>Regulation remains unclear in many jurisdictions</td><td>Regulation based on local and international rules to apply to the exchange provider (KYC/AML)</td><td>Regulations based on local security laws, the jurisdiction of the STO company</td></tr><tr><td>Token application&nbsp;</td><td>Various services and usage opportunities depending on the token type</td><td>May vary depending on the type of the issued token</td><td>Full proof of ownership and application of corresponding features and rights</td></tr><tr><td>Liquidity</td><td>Liquidity based on the secondary market</td><td>Liquidity in the primary and secondary market</td><td>Liquidity provided by STO-enabled exchanges</td></tr><tr><td>Investor rights</td><td>No associated investor rights, but the community might enforce them</td><td>Legally binding investor rights only for security tokens</td><td>Legally binding investor rights guaranteed by instrument type</td></tr><tr><td>Vetting/Due diligence</td><td>If processed, by broader community around the ICO company</td><td>Done in full responsibility by the listing exchange</td><td>Vetting provided by relevant regulators and third parties</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Typical token-based fundraising</td><td>ICO on a cryptocurrency exchange</td><td>Regulated tokensale of securities</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Similarities in ICO, STO, and IEO</strong></h3>



<p>Even though there are many differences between ICOs, IEOs, and STOs, they have many things in common, too.</p>



<p>Here are the main similarities in starting ICO, STO, or IEO:</p>



<ul><li>They require thorough preparation before the launch.</li><li>The project (or the platform it is listed on) needs to have an existing community or create one from scratch to achieve the fundraising goal and succeed.</li><li>The team has to prepare detailed documentation to present the project to the general public (Whitepaper is a must, Bluepaper and Onepager are optional).</li><li>For better performance and outcomes, it is highly recommended to hire experienced advisors to the team.</li></ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of an ICO, STO, and IEO</h2>



<p>Launching an ICO, IEO, or STO can be pretty challenging, but it is definitely worth it if done correctly. We have gathered all the benefits of these types of fundraising so that you make a grounded choice and conduct a successful launch.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>ICO</strong></td><td><strong>STO</strong></td><td><strong>IEO</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Easy to launch</td><td>Only accessible to properly authenticated investors</td><td>Already existing community of potential investors</td></tr><tr><td>Lower launching cost</td><td>Handle real assets and comply with government regulations</td><td>Traders in the exchange are already KYC/AML verified</td></tr><tr><td>Low entry threshold for participants</td><td>Offers high security, which makes it ideal for long-term investment</td><td>Easier to issue tokens compared to an ICO</td></tr><tr><td>Limited government intervention, fewer regulations</td><td>Better market acceptance than ICO and IEO</td><td>Immediate liquidity for projects after raising capital</td></tr><tr><td>The fundraising process is simpler when compared to STO and IEO</td><td></td><td>Less marketing budget required</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Of course, each method has certain loopholes and bottlenecks that you might need to face. That’s why we recommend hiring an experienced advisor long before you start an ICO, IEO, or STO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, you should find an advisor as soon as you build the concept of your project and begin working on details. This way, you’ll save yourself a lot of time and prevent double work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to launch your ICO, IEO, or STO</h2>



<p>So let’s say you have chosen the optimal fundraising method. What’s next? What exactly should you do to launch your ICO or another your own fundraising campaign and succeed?</p>



<p>Based on the <a href="https://blaize.tech/">Blaize</a> team experience and industry best practices, we have compiled a short guide on launching successful blockchain-based crowdfunding, regardless of the selected type of campaign. We hope that following these steps will make the whole process easier for you and your team.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Whitepaper</strong></h3>



<p>As you have thought through the idea of your project, you should focus on creating an elaborate Whitepaper that would contain all the information about the business model, product tech stack, tokenomics, project development, and much more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1020" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic1-3.jpg" alt="Perfect Whitepaper for the launch of an ICO, IEO, or STO" class="wp-image-9095" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic1-3.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic1-3-1536x979.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic1-3-1568x1000.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>As we have mentioned before, a successful launch of an ICO is not a piece of cake in 2023, but a properly written Whitepaper can make it much easier.</p>



<p>Here is what a well-structured Whitepaper should contain:</p>



<ul><li>Market overview and a description of the existing problems that the project solves.</li><li>The main idea of the project, its concept and mission.</li><li>Business model and fundraising method.</li><li><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/tokenomics-for-crypto-games-how-to-develop-economy-for-gamefi/">Tokenomics</a>, including token implementation, its interaction with the product, token distribution, etc.</li><li>Details of the token generation event.</li><li>Roadmap and plans for further product development.</li><li>Description of the team behind the project, their relevant experience, and links to social media (usually LinkedIn).</li></ul>



<p>Make sure that your Whitepaper is well-structured, easy to understand, and provides all the necessary details for the investor to fully understand the idea of the project and fundraising. However, do not create an excessively long document – anything between 10-50 pages would do great.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Gather a reliable team</strong></h3>



<p>Building an experienced and trustworthy team is another essential step when launching an IEO, ICO, or STO. Make sure that the people you hire bring value to the project, have relevant experience, and, ideally, have gained a reputation in the blockchain industry.</p>



<p>To boost the credibility of your project, show the core team members on the project website and in the Whitepaper. And don’t forget to include the links to their personal profiles on LinkedIn or Twitter.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Find the right advisors</strong></h3>



<p>To launch your STO, ICO, or another fundraising campaign, you need advisors. They are as important as the core team members since they make a great impact on the project development throughout the whole journey. The trick is to find the right advisors long before the launch of an ICO, IEO, or STO. This way, you will get the most out of their expertise and will be able to get valuable advice from the very first steps of your project.</p>



<p>Usually, you can find advisors on blockchain-related conferences and events, through your network, and even on LinkedIn. Present the project and your traction to get their attention and discuss the possible ways of cooperation.</p>



<p>Similar to the team profiles, you should definitely add advisors to your landing page and the Whitepaper, especially if the team doesn’t have much experience.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Choose your fundraising strategy</strong></h3>



<p>Next, you should make up your mind on the fundraising strategy. Decide on launching an STO, ICO, or IEO based on your project specifications and preferences, and make sure to consult your advisors beforehand.</p>



<p>Besides, you should think through the fundraising process. How many investment rounds will you have? Are they gonna be private or public? If you choose to conduct at least one private round, which investment funds are you going to contact, and how will you present your project?</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Create a marketing plan</strong></h3>



<p>Choose the most suitable platforms for promoting your project depending on the type of fundraising and create a marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When launching an IEO, the promotion of your project will be partially done by the exchange you choose as a launching platform. However, in the case of an ICO, full responsibility will fall on your shoulders.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic2.jpg" alt="Marketing strategy when launching an ICO, IEO, or STO" class="wp-image-9096" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic2.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic2-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic2-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>We believe that the marketing campaign should cover all the stages of your project development, including pre-launch, launch, and post-launch. Remember that you are working on your brand in the first place, so your project name should be well-known regardless of the product development stage.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Prepare for the launch an ICO or another</strong></h3>



<p>Finally, as you have done all the preliminary work, it’s time to prepare for the launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This stage will fully depend on the type of fundraising you choose. For an ICO, you’ll need to launch your own platform. If you decide to have an IEO, you’ll have to contact various exchanges and choose the one that fits you best. In the case of an STO, the major part of the preparation will be connected with the legal area and the correct submission of the product and your tokens.</p>



<p>The launch itself is an extremely thrilling event, very emotional, and at times, disappointing. But if you follow the steps we’ve described above and have the right attitude, you have a high chance of success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happens after launching an ICO, IEO, or STO</h2>



<p>The launch of an ICO, IEO, or STO is not the final step of your project development journey, though, and we are sure you understand it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you are done with the fundraising, the most interesting part begins – product development. This is the time to fulfill all the promises you made in the Whitepaper and during your pre-launch campaign to the investors and future users.</p>



<p>We highly recommend you maintain constant communication with your investors and create a community of project supporters at an early stage of project development. This way, it will be much easier to promote the product or new products of the ecosystem in the future.</p>



<p>You should also remember to move on with your marketing strategy and keep promoting the product, as it is an integral part of any post-launch campaign.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to choose advisors for your ICO, IEO, or STO</h2>



<p>Advisors are a vital part of any product team starting ICO, STO, or IEO campaigns. But how can you choose the right people for this kind of job?</p>



<p>As we have mentioned previously, you can find advisors in different places: blockchain events, conferences, summits, your <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-choose-the-right-blockchain-network-for-your-dapp-development/">network</a>, LinkedIn, etc. To make sure that this is the expert you are looking for, make sure to check out their experience, research other projects they participated in, and see if you have the essential “connection” or “spark” to work together.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://blaize.tech/">Blaize team</a> has extensive experience in assisting projects with different fundraising campaigns, so we’ll be happy to help you, too. Our specialists have expertise in different areas of getting ready for a launch, including the following:&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">To sum up the ICO vs STO vs IEO dilemma</h2>



<p>If you have decided to launch your own fundraising campaign, choosing a suitable method is one of the first things to do. And even though ICOs, IEOs, and STOs have many things in common, they are still pretty different in terms of the preparation, the launch process, and communication with your target audience.</p>



<p>In case you need to recall the distinct features of these three types of fundraising, we’ve prepared a summary picture that you can download.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1469" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic3.jpg" alt="Main differences between ICO, STO, and IEO" class="wp-image-9097" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic3.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic3-1536x1410.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/pic3-1568x1440.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New crypto games emerge almost every week, but only a few selected ones remain existing and growing. A critical factor behind this reality is the intricacy of tokenomics – the structure of the project’s economic and value systems; simply put, token economics.</p>



<p>The downfall of many promising games can often be traced back to poorly developed tokenomics. Consider a hypothetical web3 game, having advanced graphics and curious gameplay. Despite its initial hype, it failed to craft a sustainable economic model. The in-game currency was awarded so easily that it soon flooded the market, leading to hyperinflation and diminishing the coins&#8217; value. Players who had invested time and resources felt the sting as their hard-earned treasures lost significance, ultimately leading to a mass withdrawal.</p>



<p>And, unfortunately, this story isn’t made up. A game&#8217;s success depends not just on its entertainment value but on a robust economic system that maintains a balance between earning and spending within the digital ecosystem. As we delve into the topic of tokenomics, we&#8217;ll explore what factors are to be considered to build a strong and reliable tokenomics for GameFi project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT IS TOKENOMICS?</h2>



<p>Tokenomics is one of the fundamental elements of any blockchain-based project, including games. It creates utility for the project&#8217;s token and pushes the protocol&#8217;s internal economy. From this point of view, the concept is simple &#8211; every project with a token will have its tokenomics. Either it is just a token emission, a bound of native token to in-game NFTs, or shows the generation of the player&#8217;s income &#8211; tokenomics should describe it. Investors pay special attention to this chapter of the project&#8217;s Whitepaper and mainly access the game based on its tokenomics design.</p>



<p>Today, we’ll share our experience and knowledge in this area, which will hopefully assist you in designing tokenomics for your crypto game. So buckle up, and don’t forget to save this article for easy access!</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Basic Tokenomics models</h1>



<p>Since the blockchain emerged and Bitcoin was introduced, projects have mostly used deflationary tokenomics models. Such models assume a fixed token supply with less and less money issued over time. Many famous cryptocurrencies are governed under this model, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Solana, Tron, and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, you can choose an inflationary tokenomics model when building tokenomics for your crypto game. In this case, tokens will only increase in supply, but certain mechanics will help you limit inflation or even create a deflationary system. Good examples of such a crypto tokenomics model are Ethereum, Polkadot, and Polygon, which don’t have the maximum token supply.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1020" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-1.jpg" alt="Deflationary and Inflationary tokens with examples" class="wp-image-8032" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-1.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-1-1536x979.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-1-1568x1000.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>There are several types of deflationary and inflationary tokenomics models, including the ones that maintain certain features of both. Here is a brief list of the key models of crypto gaming tokenomics:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Basic deflationary model</strong> (BTC, XRP, SOL) – The project releases a fixed number of tokens at a token generation event. Such a limited supply naturally creates demand, driving investors to purchase.</li><li><strong>Buyback and burn</strong> (BNB) – The project buys tokens back from holders and burns them, removing them from the supply and balancing the economy.</li><li><strong>Burn on transaction</strong> (SAFEMOON) – The protocol creates a special tax on transactions that is written in its smart contract. It burns the tax, removing it from the total supply, or distributes it among token holders.</li><li><strong>Net deflationary model </strong>(CRV) – Although there is no maximum token supply, the burn rate from taxes or buybacks fully compensates the issuance rate and creates demand.</li></ul>



<p>Since there is no such thing as the “right” GameFi economy, you can freely choose the tokenomics of your game that will fit the protocol best and benefit all parties.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">TOKENOMICS ANALYSIS</h2>



<p>In the realm of GameFi, tokenomics stands as an integral element, as it forms the way how both the protocol and its users get their income, and it balances the internal fund flows.. This analysis delves into the dynamics of token supply and demand, dissecting the mechanisms that dictate their flow and influence in the GameFi economy. By comprehensively understanding these elements, stakeholders can better navigate the complex interplay of factors that determine a game&#8217;s financial success and sustainability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>TOKENS SUPPLY</strong></h3>



<p>The supply side of tokenomics in GameFi is governed by intricate models and mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The deflationary model exemplifies a capped token supply, creating scarcity and potential value appreciation over time. Prominent in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, this model ensures a finite supply, akin to digital gold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversely, the inflationary model, employed by platforms like Ethereum, adopts a continually increasing supply, counterbalanced by strategies to temper inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Token supply in GameFi refers to the total number of tokens available within the game&#8217;s ecosystem. This supply can either be fixed or variable, depending on the game&#8217;s tokenomic model.</p>



<p>Token supply is formed through initial minting processes and can be adjusted over time via various mechanisms. These mechanisms include burning tokens or creating more through specific game events or actions.</p>



<p><strong>Factors Impacting Tokens Supply:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Minting Rules: Guidelines defining how and when new tokens are created, especially in connection to in-game rewards.</li><li>Burning Mechanisms: Processes for permanently removing tokens from circulation.</li><li>Issuance Protocols: Methods and rules for distributing tokens initially and over time.</li><li>Deflationary/Inflationary Models: Choice between a fixed supply (deflationary) or an ever-increasing supply (inflationary).</li><li>Smart Contract Regulations: Automated rules impacting token generation and destruction.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>TOKENS DEMAND</strong></h3>



<p>The demand facet in tokenomics is multifaceted, influenced by a blend of utility, security, and exclusivity. Utility tokens are more than mere currency; they unlock access to game features and services, enhancing player engagement and loyalty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Token demand in GameFi represents the desire or need for tokens within the game&#8217;s economy. It is a measure of how much players, investors, and users value and seek out the tokens.</p>



<p>Demand is shaped by the perceived utility and value of the tokens, influenced by their integration into game mechanics, rewards systems, and overall market sentiment.</p>



<p><strong>Factors Impacting Tokens Demand:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Utility and Benefits: The practical uses and advantages offered by the tokens, access tiers and subscriptions.</li><li>Gameplay Integration: The extent to which tokens are woven into the game&#8217;s mechanics and rewards.</li><li>Market Perception and Speculation: How players and investors view the token&#8217;s potential for value appreciation.</li><li>Liquidity in the Market: The ease with which tokens can be traded.</li><li>Staking Opportunities: Chances to earn more tokens or in-game advantages through staking.</li><li>Regulatory Influences: Legal and policy factors affecting token usage and trading.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Essential token mechanics</h2>



<p>To build a powerful tokenomics for a blockchain game, you should know all its elements and how they interact with each other. Moreover, it is crucial to understand what mechanics are used to create, route, and alter tokens, their advantages and flaws. Most probably, you already know that any crypto game functions with the help of smart contacts, similar to other blockchain-based systems. But what about the rest of the mechanics?</p>



<p>For you to take a deeper dive into this topic, we’ve decided to share all the details of token mechanics and its elements, even the simplest ones. If you feel like you have extensive expertise in this field, feel free to skip some parts of this chapter.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">By the way, our team of experts offers comprehensive <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/token-development-services/">token development services</a></strong>, covering everything from token creation to post-launch maintenance and support.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Coins &amp; Tokens</strong></h3>



<p>The notions of “coins” and “tokens” are pretty close in the blockchain industry and can often be used interchangeably. However, they might still imply different things, so let’s define them once and for all.</p>



<p>Both concepts may refer to an entity that is a storage of value, digital money of some kind. But, a token also represents something a holder can do or own, as a sign of ownership or access. And do not misinterpret it with utility &#8211; as both coin and token will have it. A main distinctive feature that will help you tell coins from tokens is a blockchain – coins are issued as a native asset for blockchain &#8211; part of the consensus layer, while tokens are secondary entities launched on smart contracts as part of the execution layer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic2.jpg" alt="Examples of coins and tokens" class="wp-image-8033" width="1041" height="663" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic2.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic2-1536x979.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic2-1568x1000.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1041px) 100vw, 1041px" /></figure>



<p>There are many types of tokens, including the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Utilities</strong> – tokens that can be exchanged for some utility, service, or product feature.</li><li><strong>Securities</strong> – tokens that act like equity shares, granting their holders a voting right for the company governance and/or proceeds.</li><li><strong>Non-fungible tokens</strong> (NFTs) – unique assets, including pieces of art, digital land, game awards, etc. NFTs play a huge role in tokenomics for blockchain games. By the way, our team provides <a href="https://blaize.tech/nft-development-services/"><strong>NFT development services</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Fungibility</strong></h3>



<p>Fungibility is the feature of a token that defines how it can be exchanged with other tokens. It is one of the basic attributes of any asset, which simplifies trade and enables token swap.</p>



<p>According to this criterion, all tokens can be divided into fungible and non-fungible (NFTs).</p>



<p>Fungible tokens are the ones that can be easily exchanged without loss of function or value. On the other hand, non-fungible tokens are unique assets that store specific metadata that makes them distinguishable from other tokens and eliminates the possibility of a token swap.</p>



<p>Due to their essence, fungible tokens make great in-game currencies – users can trade or spend them anytime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NFTs are usually used as gaming items like armor, avatars, weapons, equipment, etc. Since they are non-fungible, users can’t exchange them for other NFTs, but only sell on a secondary market or a built-in marketplace. NFTs play a huge role in tokenomics for blockchain games. You may also like <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/analysis/how-to-develop-your-own-nft-platform-in-2023/"><strong>NFT platform development</strong></a> guide.</p>



<p>While speaking about fungibility, it’s important as well to mention the utility tokens – tokens that can be exchanged for some utility, service, or product feature.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Buyback and burn</strong></h3>



<p>The buyback-and-burn mechanism in the crypto industry involves the project team buying tokens back from token holders and burning them. This way, tokens are removed from the total supply, and the game economy is balanced out.</p>



<p>The whole buyback-and-burn process is encoded into smart contracts, similar to all other aspects of blockchain-based games. Thus, this process is automated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Minting</strong></h3>



<p>Minting is a process of new token creation. This can include generating new tokens in staking programs of GameFi protocols, preparing the initial token supply by the protocol owners, or emitting tokens during tokensales or in-game events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of an NFT, minting may mean publishing new in-game items, new unique in-game characters or even user accounts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Issuance</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-2.jpg" alt="Token issuance" class="wp-image-8034" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-2.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-2-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-2-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Issuance is the mechanics of distributing tokens. This might include various forms of allocation: a pre-sale, an IPO, direct purchase by players, rewards, Airdrops, etc.</p>



<p>It is a common practice to include a vesting period when issuing tokens. This way, users won’t be able to dump them right after buying, which will help stabilize the demand and token value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Burning</strong></h3>



<p>Burning is the process of permanently taking the tokens out of circulation, often by completely destroying them. It is a frequent part of the tokenomic mechanics for crypto games that are built with the inflationary tokenomics model in mind since it regulates the overall token supply and prevents the token value from a rapid drop.</p>



<p>There are two main approaches to burning tokens:</p>



<ul><li>by reducing the token supply automatically with the help of a smart contract;</li><li>by sending tokens to an inaccessible wallet.</li></ul>



<p>The first, automatic, way is much more common since it enables easier protocol maintenance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Inflation</strong></h3>



<p>In the blockchain industry, inflation is somewhat different from traditional finance. It still happens when the total supply of tokens is increasing due to constant minting or issuance. However, this does not mean that the token loses its value – such a dynamic is controlled by the special mechanics of crypto tokenomics.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Staking</strong></h3>



<p>Staking is the process of locking a particular amount of tokens in a wallet to help build blocks and earn rewards. Staking is a prominent feature in the tokenomics of many projects, offering a mechanism for token holders to earn rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By participating in staking programs, users can lock up their tokens for a period, contributing to the project&#8217;s liquidity and stability. In return, they receive rewards, often in the form of additional tokens, which can equate to earning interest on their holdings. These programs engage users to hold onto their tokens, thus reducing market volatility and reinforcing the token&#8217;s value over time. Staking not only benefits the individual token holder with passive income but also bolsters the overall health and functionality of the ecosystem by ensuring a steady supply of tokens in circulation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pic2-3.jpg" alt="Full process of staking step by step" class="wp-image-39248" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pic2-3.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pic2-3-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pic2-3-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>While in DeFi, staking is essential to enable block validation by those who are interested in the protocol the most, crypto games use it for a different reason. In games, staking is often used to distribute the revenue among players.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Treasury</strong></h3>



<p>Treasury is a specific address that accumulates and distributes tokens according to the rules encoded in the smart contract.</p>



<p>There are various methods of token distribution when it comes to treasuries in crypto games:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Staking</strong> – Users stake tokens to get a share of the tokens from the treasury or at least a chance of a share.</li><li><strong>Player rewards</strong> – Users get tokens for their in-game achievements like winning a contest, scoring in a race, etc.</li><li><strong>Team remuneration</strong> – Advisors and developers can get their share of the tokens from the treasury, but such mechanics have to be specifically indicated in the project documentation.</li><li><strong>Liquidity</strong> – The treasury may provide tokens to ensure liquidity, regulate token price, and prevent price manipulations.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Voting</strong></h3>



<p>Voting is an essential part of any decentralized system, including crypto games. Many platforms allow players to participate in the protocol’s governance by voting for particular changes with tokens. In such a way, token holders can influence the development of the game, treasury mechanics, community support, etc.</p>



<p>When you design tokenomics for a game, you should consider enabling particular community governance mechanics as it will help you turn the game into an autonomous organization and develop it in the players’ best interests.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11. Pegging</strong></h3>



<p>Price pegging means tying the value of a token to any other asset, including cryptocurrency, fiat, and even real-world commodities such as gold. Besides, it can involve pegging a token at a certain price (e.g., $0,25, $1, $50, etc.).</p>



<p>You might have heard that USDT stablecoin is pegged to USD 1:1. This means that the price of 1 USDT will always be 1 USD since the value to crypto is tied to fiat in this case.</p>



<p>Currencies in crypto games might also be pegged to other assets because such a practice removes the aspect of volatility, allowing for stable price regardless of external conditions and certain predictability when it comes to trading.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>12. Wrapping &amp; Bridging</strong></h3>



<p>Both wrapping and bridging are ways to move assets from one blockchain to another without too much stress. With the help of a bridge, tokens can be locked on one blockchain while their new, wrapped version is created and later traded on another chain.</p>



<p>For instance, wETH (wrapped Ethereum) is an ERC-20 compatible version of ETH that can be used on other chains. wETH is pegged to ETH price, so their values are tied.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">TOKENOMICS EXAMPLES</h2>



<p>Our track of success at Blaize is showcased not just through our extensive theoretical knowledge but also through our successful real-world applications. Let’s take a closer look at Blaize case studies where our innovative tokenomic strategies have been applied to create dynamic, decentralized games.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/decentralized-app-development-for-the-crypto-game/">DApp Development for the Crypto Game</a></strong></h3>



<p>This project showcased Blaize&#8217;s prowess in developing a blockchain-based protocol for the Nomo Fantasy Leagues, intricately weaving together NFTs, ERC-20 tokens, and DeFi elements. A notable aspect of tokenomics here was the use of smart contracts for NFTs representing sports players, directly linking their market value and tradeability to their real-world performance. This tokenization not only enabled users to engage in a dynamic market of buying, selling, and staking tokens but also to reap rewards in a performance-based yield pool, adding a layer of financial strategy to fantasy sports​​​​​​​​. The advanced staking system developed by our team, bound together incentives mechanism, NFTs utility and existing game mechanics. Thus, it is a perfect example of how tokenomics designed prior development and implemented in the game engages users for participation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/app-development-for-the-crypto-game-nomo-fantasy-basketball-league/">Fantasy Basketball App Development</a></strong></h3>



<p>In this iteration, Blaize demonstrated advanced tokenomics principles by upgrading contracts for the new Fantasy NBA League under the LeagueDAO’s Nomo protocol. The development of unique NFTs for each athlete, mirroring their real-world stats, was a key tokenomic feature, adding a layer of authenticity and value to each token. The blend of smart contract development and diverse technology stack resulted in a robust GameFi sports platform, where tokenomics played a central role in enabling users to actively participate in the Nomo Fantasy Basketball League using specialized Player Tokens​​.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/nft-game-development-fantasy-football-league/">NFT Game Development – Fantasy Football League</a></strong></h3>



<p>This project was a leap forward in tokenomics upgrade, focusing on developing the NFL Fantasy Football Mega League as a season-long fantasy league with team drafts represented through NFTs. A crucial tokenomic element was the management of smart contracts that underpinned the game&#8217;s structure, ensuring a fair and balanced distribution of auto-picked NFT players. This approach maintained the integrity and competitiveness of the league, emphasizing the tokenomic principle of value distribution and scarcity. The end result was a blockchain-based platform offering an immersive gaming experience, heavily reliant on tokenomics for its operational and strategic framework​​​​​​.</p>



<p>These examples illustrate Blaize&#8217;s proficiency in combining various blockchain technologies and tokenomic principles to create engaging, decentralized sports gaming platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The motivation of participants in crypto games</h2>



<p>When it comes to crypto games tokenomics, the team has to think through the motivation for several participants, not just gamers like in traditional systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, we are working with three vital parties: players, developers, and investors. In order for a crypto game to function well and retain the necessary balance, all parties have to be encouraged and remunerated on a constant basis.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For players</strong></h3>



<p>Traditional games were created and are still developed mostly with a recreational aim – players are motivated by the gaming process itself. However, it is not the case for crypto games.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic3.jpg" alt="Player's motivation in P4F and P2E games" class="wp-image-8036" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic3.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic3-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic3-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Crypto games have introduced a double motivational system:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Play-for-Fun (P4F)</strong> – Similarly to traditional games, players are motivated by leisure. It is fun for them to spend time playing a game, which is clear from the name of this type of gaming. Commonly, users also have to spend money buying the game and even while playing it.</li><li><strong>Play-to-Earn (P2E)</strong> – In this kind of games, players have monetary motivation in the first place. As they spend time in the game and achieve particular milestones, they get rewarded with tokens, which can be spent on in-game items, traded, or exchanged and withdrawn in fiat currencies.</li></ul>



<p>The most interesting part is that while P4F games’ success depends on the game mechanics, the plot, and many other factors, P2E games gain popularity with the help of players. Due to the fact that players’ income depends on the success of the game, P2E crypto games regularly become viral and grow the community much faster than traditional ecosystems.</p>



<p>And yet, there are also two types of games within the P2E sector that differ in the motivational mechanics. These are commodity grind games and content generation ones.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Commodity grind </strong>– Players need to grind the game to create commodities and earn this way.</li><li><strong>Content generation or Create-to-Earn (C2E)</strong> – Players create new content in the game, thus <a href="https://blaize.tech/blockchain-ecosystems/"><strong>developing the ecosystem</strong></a> and earning rewards. Also, they might generate external content, such as streams or videos, to spread the word about the game.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For developers</strong></h3>



<p>The second actor in any crypto game is developers, internal and external. These are key infrastructure participants since they build the game, making it appealing to players and investors.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Internal developers</strong> – The ones that are directly involved in the development process on a daily basis, including the main team, contractors, or participants of the DAO. Their motivation is pretty understandable since they mostly earn a salary and/or rewards based on their performance and game development roadmap.</li><li><strong>External developers</strong> – These are programmers who are not employed officially but motivated in a different way, usually by special monetary rewards or community recognition. Such participants are harder to motivate than internal developers, but they are also crucial to any crypto game because they make it truly decentralized.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For investors</strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to building tokenomics for GameFi, most projects rely on investors in the first place, forgetting about other parties. However, this is probably the most diverse and, at times, overlapping role in the ecosystem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic4.jpg" alt="Types of crypto game investors" class="wp-image-8037" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic4.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic4-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic4-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>The thing is that players and developers can easily become investors, too, if they believe in the product and want to support the game development process. Their motivation, though, is pretty easy to understand – they expect to get profit and increase their capital.</p>



<p>There are several main types of crypto game investors:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Backers (Seed investors)</strong> – The ones who come early to back the development of the game and help it get released to the market.</li><li><strong>Portfolio investors</strong> – Those who are building and diversifying their portfolio. Such investors usually choose a project based on its performance and potential.</li><li><strong>Governors</strong> – The ones who invest in a game to have a word in its development and distribution.</li><li><strong>Crypto traders</strong> – Regular investors who are not that much interested in the game itself but rather in token value. Mostly, they are less picky when choosing assets, but they still perform research before investing.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Different types of tokenomic systems</h2>



<p>Even though crypto games are still quite a new industry, there are already several types of their tokenomics design. Let us explain in more detail.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Play-to-Earn</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic5.jpg" alt="P2E tokenomics based on different types of rewards" class="wp-image-8038" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic5.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic5-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic5-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>As we’ve mentioned before, any P2E game is based on motivating players with certain rewards. These can be native in-game tokens or NFTs, including characters, armor, weapons, pieces of land, and other equipment that can be used during gaming.</p>



<p>Usually, P2E players are best motivated with the help of tokens that can be easily exchanged for fiat currency or other assets, so liquidity is the key.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Voting and Dividends</strong></h3>



<p>Governance tokens are a common thing for crypto games. They enable voting on the game development process, introducing new features, characters, and locations, changing game mechanics, etc.</p>



<p>Often, governance tokens also allow for dividends, acting similar to traditional equity shares. In this case, token holders receive regular passive income from the treasury.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tokensales</strong></h3>



<p>Pre-sales and IPOs or ICOs are a form of fundraising that allows the core team to receive funds for game development and investors to get tokens of a promising project.</p>



<p>During a tokensale, two types of tokens are usually distributed: governance and utility ones.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Governance tokens</strong> grant voting rights and allow token holders to participate in the decision-making process.</li><li><strong>Utility tokens</strong> offer some in-game utility while not providing any shares of the company or voting rights.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>External sources</strong></h3>



<p>Different exchanges, <a href="https://blaize.tech/decentralized-application/">dApps</a>, and NFT marketplaces might also play a role in the tokenomics for games. If game tokens are listed on any other external platform, traders might purchase them, thus adding to the liquidity and increasing token value.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">How to develop the economy for your crypto game?</h1>



<p>So, wondering how to build a crypto game economy? While the journey can be intricate, diving deep into resources like our <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/services/nft-development-services/how-to-build-a-play-to-earn-p2e-game/">how to create a p2e game guide</a></strong> can be a good starting point. However, the process involves multiple stages and is best left to experts. We strongly suggest enlisting an experienced team to navigate the nuances seamlessly</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1020" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic6-1.jpg" alt="The process of building tokenomics for crypto games step by step" class="wp-image-8039" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic6-1.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic6-1-1536x979.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic6-1-1568x1000.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 1. DEFINE THE PARTICIPANTS YOUR GAME SERVES</strong></h3>



<p>First, think through all the parties involved in the ecosystem. Will you engage external developers? What kind of investors would you like to attract, and how exactly are you going to keep them interested?</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 2. DEFINE THE MOTIVES THAT ATTRACT PARTICIPANTS</strong></h3>



<p>Second, as you know potential participants, you should define their motivation. What needs and wants do they have? How will you meet their expectations? How will you keep them involved in the gaming process when it is released?</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 3. DEFINE THE CORE MECHANICS OF YOUR GAME</strong></h3>



<p>Next, you should think about the game mechanics in detail. How will your game stand out among competitors? How will you maintain and adapt the game if necessary? How will you grow the community, and which mechanics are you going to use to make it popular?</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 4. DEFINE THE TOKENOMICS MODEL YOU WANT</strong></h3>



<p>Then, choose the tokenomics model and token functions within your game ecosystem. Will you use governance tokens or only utility ones? What will be the total token supply, if any? How will you distribute tokens, and how will you motivate the community to buy them in order to raise funds?</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 5. DEFINE CORE TOKEN DYNAMICS</strong></h3>



<p>Finally, your goal is to decide how to add tokens to the general circulation supply and get them out of there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should clearly establish the ways for players to get tokens and spend them. If there are a lot of tokens in the market and players have no way to spend them, the token rapidly loses its value as there is no reason to hold it or buy it. And vice versa, If there are not enough tokens in the market, the supply is concentrated mostly in whales’ wallets, and you lose the community.</p>



<p>As you can see, there are a lot of questions to be answered when building tokenomics for a crypto game. If you have little experience in this area, it is much easier to hire contractors who specialize in such processes and who will help you develop a popular and profitable game.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently asked questions</h1>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is crypto gaming tokenomics?</strong></h3>



<p>Crypto games tokenomics is one of the fundamental aspects of any project, which describes the supply and demand of the game. It includes the correlation between in-game NFTs and the native token, overall token supply, various token mechanics, the encouragement system, and so on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What kind of tokenomics for games should I choose?</strong></h3>



<p>When building tokenomics for your game, you should consider many factors, including the key participants of the ecosystem (players, developers, investors), their motivation, core mechanics, etc. Only after defining all these aspects will you be able to develop the tokenomics that would fit you best and help your game succeed.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to build a crypto game economy?</strong></h3>



<p>To develop tokenomics of your game, you’ll need to go through several steps:</p>



<ol><li>Define the participants your game serves</li><li>Define the motives that attract participants</li><li>Define the core mechanics of your game</li><li>Define the tokenomics model you want</li><li>Define core token dynamics</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While the whole community is keenly looking forward to the next phase of the Polkadot mainnet launch, Blaize’s team of blockchain architects want to share some knowledge using Polkadot Substrate for building parachains.</p>



<p>We have reviewed some of the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most promising Polkadot startups</a> in one of our previous articles. In this blog post, we would like to explain how to launch a project on Polkadot, develop a dApp similar to these examples, or implement a parachain. We will also describe how to make a cross-chain bridge between Polkadot and other existing solutions. And if you are interested in <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/decentralized-application/">dApp development services</a></strong>, please contact us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Do You Need to Develop a dApp on Polkadot?</strong></h2>



<p>Polkadot is a fast-growing ecosystem that will enable cross-chain communication within its parachains. Such interoperability and scale will bring blockchain technology to the next level and solve a number of problems (e.g. low TPS, high transaction fees, hard forks, etc.).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum DeFi is one of the biggest markets for dApp development. The growing number of Polkadot dApps heightens the problem of Ethereum chain operability as well as transaction costs. Polkadot&#8217;s scalable and interoperable environment makes it very attractive in terms of Ethereum DeFi’s future migration to Polkadot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read Also: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/which-blockchain-to-fork-to-start-your-own-cryptocurrency/">How to fork a cryptocurrency</a></strong></p>



<p>The claim has already proven its relevance through the successful implementation of new solutions like RIO Chain. It is built as a Polkadot parachain that provides ready-made tools to <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-build-a-successful-defi-project/">develop DeFi dApp</a> on Polkadot. As an alternative, you can build Polkadot dApp on Substrate-based chains or deploy smart contracts to Moonbeam or Edgeware. </p>

<p><em>We will explain how to develop and launch your dApp project on Polkadot in the following sections of this article.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Initial integration with Polkadot&nbsp;</h2>



<p>From our experience, <strong><em>we can define the following types of possible launch on Polkadot:</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#BUILDING-A-PARACHAIN-TO-POLKADOT">Building a parachain for Polkadot</a></strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="#DEVELOP-A-DAPP-ON-POLKADOT">Building dApp on Substrate-based blockchain</a></strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="#CREATE-A-CROSS-CHAIN-BRIDGE-TO-THE-POLKADOT-ECOSYSTEM">Creating a cross-chain bridge</a></strong> (from your current solution to one of Polkadot’s parachains)</li>
</ol>



<p>Those are generalized examples combining a long list of possibilities into three main groups. We would like to share more technical aspects regarding each type next.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Blaize’s team of blockchain developers has been studying the unique technical specifications of the Polkadot ecosystem for a few years. We are currently working on several projects to launch on the network in the near future. <a href="https://twitter.com/blaize_tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Follow Blaize</a> news updates to see future case description in detail.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="BUILDING-A-PARACHAIN-TO-POLKADOT">Building a parachain to Polkadot</h2>



<p>Before considering this approach and starting parachain development, <strong><em>let’s define what a parachain is</em></strong> and why it is different from running an independent blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polkadot provides a highly scalable and secure ecosystem of blockchains. Yet, those blockchains are actually parachains. The main difference between them lies in <strong>shared security</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any created parachain has to be connected to the Relay Chain (the main chain of Polkadot). Along with this connection, the Relay chain will provide the parachain security and a guarantee of secure cross-chain communication (<a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-transport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCMP</a>) between all connected parachains in the system. <em>Thus, the Polkadot ecosystem ensures the desired interoperability and scalability of all chains together.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot Parachain Development</strong></h2>



<p>There is a claim that creating a Polkadot parachain requires a strong knowledge of Substrate. Substrate as well as Polkadot are written in the Rust language. Consequently, you can implement parachain development in Rust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From another perspective, generally, you can implement a custom blockchain development in any language (C++, Go or Java). If a certain interface is respected you can connect it as a parachain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, in order to ease development, Polkadot provides PDKs (which stands for Parachain Development Kit). Currently, there are two functioning PDKs which are <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Substrate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cumulus</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parity Substrate is a cutting-edge solution that allows for building a complex blockchain architecture within a short period of time. This reduces Polkadot development time significantly from years to weeks. So we recommend using the ready-made Substrate framework for building a parachain instead of writing initial <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/5-best-programming-languages-for-blockchain-development/">coding</a> in Rust, Go, or others.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><em>Previous working experience with Substrate will be a huge plus. Get to know more about the Substrate framework and its characteristics in <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development/#PARITY-SUBSTRATE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Blockchain Platforms comparison</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>The basic set of tools for Polkadot parachain development:</em></strong></h4>



<ul>
<li>Substrate 2.0.0.</li>



<li>Polkadot source code&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WASM interpreter</a> and compiler to WASM</li>



<li>Rococo&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The first step is to set up the latest version of the Substrate framework. The best way is to use Parity Knowledge Base. As soon as the environment is prepared, we can start to modify the live version of the parachain template code. The initial code can be taken from the Polkadot repository <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/roadmap/implementers-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/6d8df098600232750cc677f9d8617649.js"></script>



<p>Substrate technology contains all the necessary modules and frames for an independent chain development. But it does not have the required compatibility feature with Polkadot.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Therefore, as soon as the main chain architecture is done, you need to start using the </strong><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cumulus</a><strong> library. </strong>Cumulus will add the required parachain code while importing a Substrate-based chain to the library. Thus, it makes it compatible with the Polkadot environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to check a new-build parachain, we need a testnet examination. One of the major Polkadot testnets, <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://rococo-rpc.polkadot.io#/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rococo</a>, has been created to meet the specifications of <em>parachains testing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After testing you will need a parachain slot to deploy your chain and connect to the Relay chain. The project will need to acquire one of the parachains’ slots in the auction that will take place shortly. But take into account, you can test and deploy your parachain on <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/#KUSAMA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kusama</a> (Polkadot cousin). </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="DEVELOP-A-DAPP-ON-POLKADOT">Develop a dApp on Polkadot&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Claiming a breakthrough in operability and scalability Polkadot attracts a lot of minds eager to build dApps on Polkadot within its network. It is especially attractive for open finance developers seeking to create a full market of DeFi on Polkadot (read about <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/top-notch-defi-derivatives-you-should-know-about/"><strong>DeFi derivatives</strong></a>).</p>



<p>The first thing you should know is that the Polkadot Relay chain itself does not support any Polkadot smart contract framework. However, the arbitrary state transitions inserted into parachains do offer such support. This technology will be released shortly and will allow for building dApps on a Polkadot parachain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read Also: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/amm-solutions-to-impermanent-loss-and-front-running/">How to Avoid Impermanent Loss and Front-running Problem in DeFi</a></strong>.</p>



<p>For now, it is recommended to use one of the existing technologies and prepare your future Polkadot dApp to be ready when the parachain starts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smart contracts are a core for any decentralized application development. The Polkadot system is very complex and tiered, but there are a few ways to deploy smart contracts on Polkadot:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Develop smart contracts in any language compiled to WASM (Java, Go, etc.)</li>



<li>Develop dApp using Substrate EVM pallet&nbsp;</li>



<li>Develop dApp using Substrate <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ink</a> contracts pallet&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We will use the third approach to provide an example of dApp development for smooth integration with a Polkadot parachain in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Example of dApp development on Substrate-based chain&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Due to wider adoption of Substrate and its growing demand, we would like to show the example of using Substrate FRAME for building a dApp for Polkadot.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>The basic set of tools for (Polkadot) dApp development:</em></strong></h4>



<ul>
<li>Substrate 2.0.0.</li>



<li>Rust</li>



<li>!Ink</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WASM interpreter</a> and compiler to WASM</li>
</ul>



<p>Substrate FRAME is a code library storing ready-made modules (or otherwise pallets) to build your custom blockchain with Substrate. To create a decentralized app on top of it, one needs to combine chosen modules into the “runtime” of the framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to enable smart contract functionality we should add a <em>_contracts </em>pallet. </p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/420c26142b5e94a895a50f0341716896.js"></script>



<p>For customization, we can add all necessary imports and dependencies, develop on Polkadot custom traits within this pallet or even add more custom pallets and start the configuration.</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/26eafdb3bc3ffcfcaa0b2b66dc655df0.js"></script>



<p>After that, you can think of deploying Polkadot smart contracts for your dApp to the live environment. Currently, there are two leading solutions that offer smart contracts running via the Polkadot environment: Moonbeam and Edgeware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edgeware is a Substrate-based chain that will connect to the Relay Chain as one of the Polkadot parachains in the near future. It enables smart contracts on Polkadot to run with its further compilation to WASM. Edgeware is a perfect solution to try out the contracts made with the contracts’ pallet from the Substrate FRAME library.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In case you have chosen the Substrate EVM pallet, think of a Moonbeam smart contract solution. It uses an interoperable layer containing the current Ethereum toolset called <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier</a>. The Moonbeam platform will support all application contracts written for the EVM environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em><span class="has-inline-color has-primary-red-color">Read more detailed information about Moonbeam and Edgeware projects in <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Projects on Polkadot</a>.&nbsp;</span></em></strong></h4>



<p>To underline, <strong>you can deploy smart contracts on Polkadot only using one of its parachains.</strong> Though you can build your custom dApp on your own Substrate-based node.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, consider trying any of the smart contract solutions for Polkadot detailed above.&nbsp;Read: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/ethereum-based-dapp-development-for-trading-platform/">Ethereum dApp Development Guide</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="CREATE-A-CROSS-CHAIN-BRIDGE-TO-THE-POLKADOT-ECOSYSTEM">Create a cross-chain bridge to the Polkadot ecosystem</h2>



<p>Building a cross-chain bridge is the other way to connect to the Polkadot ecosystem. There are basically two options: create a bridge for your current solution, or provide bridge-as-a-service between two existing decentralized protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a technical point of view, a cross-chain bridge is an app for a token “transfer” between two blockchains. The transfer is made through smart contracts on both sides of the bridge and a decentralized network of independent validators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>The cross-chain bridge idea implies that tokens are moving (or transferring) between chains or protocols. But in fact, when a money transfer request occurs, the contract burns tokens on one chain and mints them on the other.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">There is a feature when the contract locks tokens instead of burning them if the initial token contract does not provide a <em>burning function. </em>Those specifications might be hard to detect for a less experienced blockchain developer. Read <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-choose-a-reliable-blockchain-company-for-your-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to find experienced blockchain developers</a> to create a solid project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to make any transaction, the contract needs a signature from a subset of validators that run the bridge. That is why the bridge is quite similar to the way a multisig contract functions. When a money transfer request goes to one of the contracts, the relayers (validators) ought to create a vote on this transaction and approve token minting on the opposite side of the bridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read also:<strong> <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/amm-types-differentiations/">AMMs models</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building a bridge using Substrate&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The Substrate framework provides a full collection of components and pallets for building bridges. The full documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bridges-common" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example, we will build a relay bridge from Ethereum to Polkadot. We decided to use !Ink because it is the primary language for smart contracts on Substrate. As an alternative, we may use Rust with no inconvenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-primary-red-color"><em>Relay bridge components:&nbsp;</em></span></strong></p>



<p><strong>01 Smart contracts&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>As we have mentioned before, we should create smart contracts on both sides of the bridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>02 Substrate pallets</strong></p>



<p>For cross-chain bridge implementation, we can use the following Substrate pallets: <em>syncing header</em> pallet, <em>arbitrary messages</em> pallet,<em> relayer</em> pallet.</p>



<p><strong>03 Validator program&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>One of the most important parts of this development is the validator program. This should take into account such parameters as the number of validators (relayers) and the established threshold for them. The threshold is the limit of required validators to approve the transaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in case there are five relayers for this bridge, and the threshold amount is three, the transaction will be approved after three confirmations occur with no need to wait for the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The daily limit is another substantial element of the validator’s program development. By establishing this feature you can specify the exact amount of funds that can be passed to one side per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The example of validation method for approving cross-chain transactions:</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/bb8e426669dc2da54d67832312e54b40.js"></script>



<p><strong>04 Application interface (UI)</strong></p>



<p>To interact with both sides of the bridge and the smart contracts in it, you will need a dApp. That is how the end-user will benefit from the bridge and <em>“transfer”</em> funds from one chain to another.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong><em>Thinking of creating a bridge? <a href="#post_contact">Contact Blaize</a> experts to schedule a meeting to start development ASAP!</em></strong></p>



<p>Existing Ethereum-based DeFi protocols should consider creating a cross-chain bridge to Polkadot. This type of development is faster than making a new dApp and has significant potential for possible interactions. You can create a bridge from the current solution to a Polkadot parachain as well as connect to existing Moonbeam contracts. Such projects as Akropolis, <a href="https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/private/adash47d-chainbridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainsafe</a>, and <a href="https://snowfork.substack.com/p/a-trustless-general-purpose-polkadot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snowfork</a> have already presented similar cross-chain solutions. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In this article, we have shown how to build a parachain on Polkadot or use a Substrate-based chain to create a dApp. We have also reviewed the process of creating a cross-chain bridge between Ethereum and Polkadot and answered the questions of why and when it is applicable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polkadot is a fast-growing ecosystem that has a great impact on the blockchain community. After reading this post, you now know how you can join it and build your own dApp or parachain for Polkadot.&nbsp;We also invite you to familiarize yourself with our expertise in the <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/nft-development-services/">development of NFT tokens</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/gamefi-development-company/">GameFi development</a></strong>.</p>
