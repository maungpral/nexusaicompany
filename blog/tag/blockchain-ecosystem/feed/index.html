<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of DePINs</h2>



<p>DePINs offer a transformative approach to infrastructure development, bringing numerous advantages that surpass traditional centralized models. These benefits are rooted in the core principles of decentralization, incentivization, transparency, efficiency, and resilience. Below is a detailed exploration of these key benefits:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Decentralization</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Elimination of Central Authorities:</strong> DePINs eliminate the reliance on central authorities by distributing control across a network of participants. This decentralization reduces the risk of single points of failure, which are common in centralized systems. For example, in a traditional energy grid, a failure at a central power plant can lead to widespread outages. In contrast, a decentralized energy grid distributes power generation across many sources, enhancing overall system resilience.</p>



<p><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By distributing data and control across a decentralized network, DePINs make it significantly harder for malicious actors to compromise the system. This is because there is no single point of vulnerability that can be targeted. Blockchain technology, which underpins DePINs, provides an immutable ledger that records all transactions transparently, further enhancing security.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Incentivization</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Token-Based Rewards:</strong> DePINs use utility tokens to incentivize participants to contribute to the network. These tokens can be earned by providing services, infrastructure, or resources, ensuring that there is a continuous motivation for participation. For instance, in decentralized wireless networks like the Helium Network, individuals earn platform tokens by providing coverage with their own hardware, such as antennas and routers.</p>



<p><strong>Economic Participation:</strong> The use of platform tokens not only incentivizes participation but also creates an economic ecosystem within the network. Participants can trade or use these utility tokens within the network, driving economic activity and sustainability. This model aligns the interests of individual participants with the overall success of the network, fostering a collaborative environment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transparency</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Immutable Records:</strong> Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and activities within a DePIN are recorded in an immutable ledger. This transparency allows for real-time auditing and verification, reducing the potential for fraud and errors. For example, in a decentralized energy network, records of electricity use can be transparently recorded and verified to ensure no tampering. This guarantees accuracy and builds trust among participants, as they can independently confirm the authenticity of the data.</p>



<p><strong>Open Access:</strong> The decentralized nature of DePINs means that all participants have access to the same information, promoting equality and reducing information asymmetry. This openness is crucial for building trust and fostering collaboration within the network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Efficiency</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Automated Processes:</strong> Smart contracts automate many of the processes within a DePIN. These contracts trigger actions, such as payments or service provisioning, when predefined conditions are met. This automation reduces the need for intermediaries, cutting down on administrative overhead and speeding up transactions.</p>



<p><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> By eliminating intermediaries and automating processes, DePINs can significantly reduce costs associated with infrastructure development and maintenance. For instance, in decentralized energy grids, smart contracts can automate the distribution and billing of energy, reducing the need for complex administrative systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resilience</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Distributed Networks:</strong> DePINs inherently possess greater resilience due to their distributed nature. In a distributed network, multiple nodes can continue to operate even if some nodes fail. This ensures continuous service availability and reduces the risk of widespread outages.</p>



<p><strong>Scalability:</strong> DePINs can scale more effectively than traditional centralized systems. As more participants join the network and contribute resources, the network’s capacity and resilience increase. This scalability is particularly important in fields like telecommunications and energy, where demand can fluctuate significantly.</p>



<p>DePINs offer a powerful alternative to traditional infrastructure models, leveraging the strengths of decentralization, incentivization, transparency, efficiency, and resilience. As the sector continues to grow and evolve, DePINs are poised to play a crucial role in the future of infrastructure development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of DePINs: PRNs and DRNs</h2>

<p>This comprehensive guide dives deeper into the intricate details of account abstraction, illuminating its impact on both protocols and users. We will explore the technical aspects of ERC-4337, showcase practical use cases, and equip you with invaluable insights to navigate this transformative shift with confidence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Account Abstraction and Why is it Needed?</h2>



<p>The current blockchain account model, dominated by EOAs, faces an inherent paradox: prioritizing simplicity at the expense of user experience. While the benefit of a single private key for control lies in its simplicity, it suffers from limitations that hinder mainstream adoption and innovative dApp development. Enter account abstraction, a paradigm shift promising to bridge this gap by introducing programmable smart contracts as wallets.</p>



<p>Imagine interacting with the blockchain not through static key pairs, but with dynamic, customizable smart contracts. This is the essence of account abstraction. It decouples the underlying account logic from the blockchain layer, empowering users with a new level of control and flexibility. But why is this change necessary?</p>



<p><strong>Current limitations of EOAs are:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Security</strong>: Single private keys are susceptible to theft, phishing, and user error. Account abstraction allows for multi-signature wallets, social recovery mechanisms, and granular access control, significantly enhancing security.</li>



<li><strong>Inefficient Transactions</strong>: Every transaction requires the same key signature process, hindering scalability. Account abstraction enables fee delegation, gasless transactions, and batched operations, improving transaction efficiency.</li>



<li><strong>Lack of Customization</strong>: EOAs offer minimal flexibility. With account abstraction, wallets can be tailored to specific use cases, integrating features like spending limits, time-locked transactions, and dApp-specific controls.</li>
</ul>



<p>By addressing these shortcomings, account abstraction paves the way for a frictionless user experience, increased security, and a flourishing dApp ecosystem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Current State of Accounts in Blockchains</strong></h3>



<p>Traditionally, blockchain accounts, particularly in Ethereum, are categorized into two main types: EOAs and contract accounts. EOAs are controlled by private keys, and contract accounts are governed by their contract code. This division, while functional, introduces limitations in security, customizability, and scalability. EOAs face security risks due to the reliance on private keys, which, if compromised, can lead to loss of assets. Furthermore, the binary nature of account types restricts the development of more nuanced and user-specific functionalities.</p>



<p>The foundation of understanding account abstraction lies in acknowledging the limitations of its predecessor, the EOA. EOAs offer simplicity, but at the cost of:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Unrecoverable Funds:</strong> Lost private keys result in lost funds, a major stumbling block for mainstream adoption.</li>



<li><strong>Inflexible Transactions:</strong> Every transaction requires the same signature process, regardless of complexity.</li>



<li><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/web3-security/9-most-common-smart-contract-vulnerabilities-found-by-blaize/"><strong>Limited Security</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Single points of failure through private keys expose accounts to theft and phishing attacks.</li>



<li><strong>Inefficient Scalability:</strong> As network usage increases, the EOA model struggles to keep up, leading to congestion and high transaction fees.</li>
</ul>



<p>While advancements like contract-based accounts (CBAs) and hierarchical deterministic wallets (HD wallets) offer some improvements, they remain limited in scope and functionality.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Account Abstraction Improves User Experience</strong></h3>



<p>Account abstraction proposes a unified model that blends the flexibility of contract accounts with the direct control of EOAs, thereby enhancing the blockchain user experience. Through mechanisms like signature abstraction and fee abstraction, account abstraction enables more user-friendly blockchain applications. Users can interact with smart contracts as seamlessly as with traditional accounts, without worrying about the complexities of gas payments and transaction signatures. This shift not only simplifies the user experience but also opens up new possibilities for application developers.</p>



<p>Account abstraction transcends these limitations by introducing an additional layer over the blockchain, which delegates most of actions to smart contracts. This unlocks a range of features that significantly enhance user experience:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Signature Abstraction:</strong> Users no longer need to manually sign transactions with private keys. Instead, smart contracts handle the signing logic, eliminating the risk of user error and phishing attacks.</li>



<li><strong>Fee Abstraction:</strong> Transaction fees can be dynamically managed through smart contracts, enabling features like fee delegation and gasless transactions for specific use cases.</li>



<li><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/web3-security/how-to-boost-smart-contract-security-and-mitigate-risks-in-defi/"><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Multi-signature wallets, social recovery mechanisms, and custom access controls can be implemented within the smart contract, mitigating single points of failure and theft risks.</li>



<li><strong>Customizable Transactions:</strong> Smart contracts can be programmed to include spending limits, time-locked transactions, and dApp-specific controls, tailoring the user experience to specific needs.</li>
</ul>



<p>These features translate to a seamless and secure interaction with the blockchain. From simplified transactions to robust security measures, account abstraction empowers users and fosters a more vibrant dApp ecosystem.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Concept of Account Abstraction</h2>



<p>Account abstraction represents a great step forward in how users interact with blockchains. Instead of the old method where accounts are just linked to keys (EOAs), this new approach separates the account&#8217;s operations by introducing a paradigm of decoupling, where account logic resides in programmable smart contracts. Let’s take a closer look at its core principles together.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Decoupling Address and Private Key</strong></h3>



<p>Traditionally, blockchain accounts function as a singular entity, where the address serves as a representation of ownership and the private key grants access and authorizes transactions. Account abstraction disrupts this tight coupling by introducing a crucial separation. The account address remains the public face, representing ownership of assets, while the private key (or any other signing mechanism) becomes decoupled and resides within the smart contract governing the account.</p>



<p>This fundamental separation unlocks plenty of benefits:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility and Customization:</strong> Smart contracts become programmable wallets, allowing for tailored functionalities like spending limits, transaction approvals by specific parties, and integration with dApps.</li>



<li><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> Complex signing processes get abstracted away, replaced by user-friendly interfaces within the smart contract, improving overall usability.</li>



<li><strong>Higher Reliability:</strong> The private key no longer directly exposes the account, mitigating theft and phishing risks. Multi-signature, time-locked, and other advanced authorization mechanisms can be implemented within the smart contract, significantly elevating security.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transitioning from Simple Accounts to Programmable Ones</strong></h3>



<p>Imagine the evolution from a basic calculator to a fully programmable computer. Account abstraction follows a similar trajectory, transforming static EOAs into <strong>dynamic and feature-rich</strong> smart contract accounts (SCAs). Let&#8217;s trace this transformation:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>EOAs:</strong> Limited to basic functions like sending and receiving tokens, governed solely by private keys.</li>



<li><strong>CBAs (Contract-Based Accounts):</strong> Introduced a layer of complexity with smart contracts controlling account logic, but still lacked flexibility and advanced features.</li>



<li><strong>HD Wallets:</strong> Offered improved key management with deterministic generation and hierarchical structures, but remained limited in functionality.</li>



<li><strong>SCAs (Smart Contract Accounts with Account Abstraction):</strong> Represent the pinnacle of this evolution, empowering accounts with:</li>
</ul>



<ol>
<li>Transactions, signing processes, and access control tailored to specific needs.</li>



<li>Multi-signature, social recovery, and advanced authorization mechanisms built into the contract.</li>



<li>Ability to interact seamlessly with dApps and DeFi protocols.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smart Wallets and Their Capabilities</strong></h3>



<p>Account abstraction unlocks a new era of account management with smart contract wallets (SCWs). Imagine EOAs evolving from simple calculators to full-fledged computers, capable of complex calculations and tailored functionalities. SCWs embody this transformation, empowering users with an unprecedented level of control and flexibility.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore the capabilities that differentiate SCWs from their basic counterparts:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Custom Logic and Rules:</strong> Unlike the rigid structure of EOAs, SCWs can be programmed with specific logic and rules governing their operation. Imagine setting spending limits, requiring multiple approvals for transactions, or integrating with specific dApps seamlessly. This customizability opens doors for a wide range of use cases.</li>



<li><strong>Increased Security:</strong> Single points of failure like private keys become relics of the past. SCWs can implement multi-signature wallets, social recovery mechanisms, and time-locked transactions, significantly bolstering security and mitigating theft risks.</li>



<li><strong>Advanced Authorization:</strong> Go beyond simple key-based approvals. SCWs allow for granular access control, specifying who can initiate transactions, under what conditions, and with what limits. This fine-grained control empowers users and safeguards their assets.</li>



<li><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/ethereum-based-dapp-development-for-trading-platform/"><strong>DApp Integration</strong></a><strong>:</strong> SCWs aren&#8217;t isolated entities. They can be programmed to interact seamlessly with various dApps and DeFi protocols, eliminating the need for multiple accounts and cumbersome manual processes. This fosters a more cohesive and user-friendly experience.</li>



<li><strong>Evolving Capabilities:</strong> The beauty of SCWs lies in their inherent upgradability. New features and functionalities can be added over time, ensuring your wallet remains adaptive and future-proof. This continuous evolution unlocks a world of possibilities for developers and users alike.</li>
</ul>



<p>These capabilities paint a picture of <strong>dynamic and intelligent wallets</strong>, far exceeding the limitations of traditional EOAs. Imagine a self-custodial wallet with time-locked withdrawals for impulse control, a multi-signature DAO treasury requiring majority approval for spending, or a dApp-specific wallet pre-configured for seamless interaction within a particular ecosystem. The possibilities are truly endless.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implementing Account Abstraction in Ethereum</h2>



<p>While the concept of account abstraction holds immense potential, its practical implementation requires specific technical considerations. In the Ethereum ecosystem, the ERC-4337 standard stands as the driving force, enabling this paradigm shift without requiring fundamental changes to the underlying protocol. Let&#8217;s delve into the specifics of this implementation and dissect the key components powering account abstraction in Ethereum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Overview of ERC-4337 Standard</h2>



<p>Unlike typical Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which often propose modifications to the core protocol, ERC-4337 takes a different approach. It introduces an additional layer, essentially building upon the existing blockchain layer without requiring consensus-level changes. This ingenious approach offers several advantages:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Faster Adoption:</strong> No need for network-wide upgrades, allowing protocols and users to embrace account abstraction at their own pace.</li>



<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> ERC-4337 can adapt and evolve independently, incorporating new features and functionalities without impacting the base Ethereum protocol.</li>



<li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Existing tools and infrastructure remain compatible, minimizing disruption and easing the transition for developers and users.</li>
</ul>



<p>Therefore, ERC-4337 acts as a <strong>bridge between EOAs and smart contract accounts</strong>, facilitating the adoption of this transformative technology.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="840" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eth-account-abstraction.webp" alt="ERC-4337 introduces a layer-two solution, essentially building upon the existing blockchain layer without requiring consensus-level changes." class="wp-image-54062" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eth-account-abstraction.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eth-account-abstraction-1536x806.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/eth-account-abstraction-1568x823.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s dissect the fundamental elements that make ERC-4337 great:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>UserOperations:</strong> These represent the core building blocks of interaction, encapsulating all transaction data, signatures, and other relevant information. They act as intermediaries between users and the blockchain, decoupling them from the complexities of key management and authorization.</li>



<li><strong>EntryPoint Contract:</strong> This smart contract serves as the central hub, validating UserOperations and relaying them to the Ethereum network. It acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring compliance with protocol rules and preventing invalid transactions.</li>



<li><strong>Paymasters:</strong> These optional entities handle transaction fees, offering flexibility and innovative possibilities. Paymasters can cover gas costs for users, sponsor specific transactions, or implement custom fee models, opening doors for novel use cases.</li>
</ul>



<p>With these core components working in concert, ERC-4337 successfully abstracts away the complexities of account management, empowering users with enhanced security, flexibility, and a superior user experience.</p>



<p>Understanding the flow of a transaction within the ERC-4337 framework sheds light on its security and reliability:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>User creates a UserOperation:</strong> This transaction data is signed using their preferred method, potentially involving multi-signature wallets or other advanced authorization mechanisms.</li>



<li><strong>UserOperation submitted to EntryPoint:</strong> The user submits the signed UserOperation to the EntryPoint contract.</li>



<li><strong>EntryPoint validates and relays:</strong> The EntryPoint verifies the signatures, ensures compliance with rules, and relays the transaction to the Ethereum network.</li>



<li><strong>Paymaster (optional):</strong> If a paymaster is involved, it handles gas fees or performs additional logic before the transaction is finalized.</li>



<li><strong>Ethereum network processes:</strong> The Ethereum network processes the transaction based on the relayed information.</li>
</ol>



<p>This multi-layered validation flow ensures the integrity and security of transactions while offering the flexibility and benefits of account abstraction.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Future of Account Abstraction in Ethereum</h2>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="700" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-eip.webp" alt="Account abstraction improves the existing ones and creates new possibilities for web3 adoption via various use cases." class="wp-image-54064" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-eip.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-eip-1536x672.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/account-abstraction-eip-1568x686.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Payments UX Improvement</strong></h3>



<p>A standout feature enabled by account abstraction is the <strong>Paymaster mechanism</strong>, which allows users to pay for transaction fees (gas) in tokens other than the native blockchain currency (e.g., paying Ethereum gas fees in stablecoins or other preferred tokens). This approach significantly simplifies the payment process for users, removing the need to hold and manage a separate balance of the native blockchain token solely for the purpose of covering transaction costs.</p>



<p>Account abstraction also facilitates the integration of <strong>seamless conversion mechanisms</strong>, such as fiat-to-crypto ramps, directly within the user&#8217;s wallet or transaction process. This capability means users can effortlessly convert their fiat currency to the required crypto assets at the point of transaction, streamlining the payment process and enhancing the overall user experience. This seamless conversion is especially beneficial for users new to the blockchain space, reducing the complexity and steps needed to participate in dApps.</p>



<p>Another significant advancement enabled by account abstraction is the <strong>facilitation of cross-chain payments</strong>. This feature allows users to execute transactions across different blockchain networks without the need for complex bridging mechanisms or third-party services. Cross-chain payments expand the usability and reach of decentralized applications by enabling a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem, where assets and information can flow freely between different networks.</p>



<p>Project implementing the aforementioned features include MetaMask Snaps and Transak.</p>

<li><strong>Optimized workflows:</strong> Submit complex multi-step actions (e.g., swapping and staking tokens) seamlessly in one go, streamlining user experience.</li>



<li><strong>Improved dApp integration:</strong> DApps can leverage batched transactions for efficient token deposits, withdrawals, and other interactions, enhancing user flow.</li>
</ul>



<p>Projects like Zapper and InstaDapp already leverage batching features, demonstrating its practicality for DeFi and wallet management.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Automating Transactions</strong></h3>



<p>Recurring payments and scheduled actions become effortless with account abstraction. Imagine:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Automated savings:</strong> Set up a smart contract to automatically transfer a portion of your paycheck to a savings account every month, enforcing financial discipline.</li>



<li><strong>Subscription payments:</strong> Pre-configure automatic token transfers for ongoing subscriptions, eliminating manual renewals and missed payments.</li>



<li><strong>Limit orders:</strong> Programmatically execute buy or sell orders at specific price points, ensuring you capture desired market opportunities.</li>
</ul>



<p>These scenarios illustrate the power of programmable wallets, opening doors for innovative use cases in finance, asset management, and beyond. Projects like Argent and Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) already offer basic automation features, with the potential for further expansion in the future.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shared Accounts</strong></h3>



<p>Account abstraction facilitates flexible and secure shared access, ideal for:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DAOs:</strong> Implement multi-signature wallets with granular access control, requiring consensus for critical decisions while allowing individual members to perform routine tasks.</li>



<li><strong>Family accounts:</strong> Share funds within a family, setting spending limits for specific members and requiring parental approval for larger transactions.</li>



<li><strong>Business accounts:</strong> Establish shared wallets for company expenses, with designated individuals authorized for specific spending categories.</li>
</ul>



<p>These use cases highlight the versatility of smart contract accounts, enabling collaboration and shared control while maintaining robust security measures. Projects like WINR Protocol and Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) cater to DAOs and other collaborative entities, showcasing the real-world value of flexible access control.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges and Outlook</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">TYPES OF BLOCKCHAIN PROGRAMMING&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Blockchain development extends beyond mere code writing; it encapsulates a spectrum of tasks, each demanding its distinct expertise.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blockchain Core Development</strong>: At the heart of blockchain technology lies the core protocol. Developers in this sphere work to design the architectural foundations: consensus algorithms, data models, and the core logic governing transactions.</li><li><strong>Smart Contract Development</strong>: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Languages like Solidity and Move are dominant in this space. Developers focus on creating decentralized applications (dApps) on platforms such as Ethereum, Diem, and Polkadot, ensuring contracts are secure and free from vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Blockchain Software Development</strong>: This concerns the creation of tools, interfaces, and applications that are not part of the core protocol but interact with it. For instance, wallet software, interfaces for smart contract interaction, or blockchain explorers fall under this category.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT ARE THE SKILLS REQUIRED FOR BLOCKCHAIN DOMAIN?</h2>



<p>Embarking on a blockchain career demands a fusion of technical and conceptual prowess:</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do you need to learn in order to start developing on the blockchain?</strong></h3>



<p>To start developing on the blockchain, you initially need a deep understanding of cryptographic principles and decentralized architectures. Mastering a blockchain-specific programming language, such as Solidity for Ethereum or Rust for Polkadot, is paramount. Familiarity with distributed ledger concepts, consensus algorithms (like PoW or PoS), and smart contract mechanics is crucial. Furthermore, hands-on experience with development tools and frameworks, such as Truffle or Hardhat for Ethereum, will facilitate a smoother entry into practical development.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Move vs Solidity. What&#8217;s the key points here? </strong></h3>



<p>Move and Solidity are both perfect languages for blockchain development but both of them have certain features. Solidity, Ethereum&#8217;s flagship language, is contract-oriented, widely adopted, and has a JavaScript-like syntax, making it accessible to many developers. In contrast, Move, developed for Facebook&#8217;s Diem (formerly Libra), introduces the concept of &#8220;resources&#8221;, which ensures assets are non-fungible and can&#8217;t be duplicated, thereby enhancing security. While Solidity compiles into EVM bytecode, Move bypasses some abstraction layers, executing directly on its native Move Virtual Machine, ensuring efficiency. The choice between the two languages depends on the specific use-case, desired blockchain platform, and security considerations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While the whole community is keenly looking forward to the next phase of the Polkadot mainnet launch, Blaize’s team of blockchain architects want to share some knowledge using Polkadot Substrate for building parachains.</p>



<p>We have reviewed some of the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most promising Polkadot startups</a> in one of our previous articles. In this blog post, we would like to explain how to launch a project on Polkadot, develop a dApp similar to these examples, or implement a parachain. We will also describe how to make a cross-chain bridge between Polkadot and other existing solutions. And if you are interested in <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/decentralized-application/">dApp development services</a></strong>, please contact us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Do You Need to Develop a dApp on Polkadot?</strong></h2>



<p>Polkadot is a fast-growing ecosystem that will enable cross-chain communication within its parachains. Such interoperability and scale will bring blockchain technology to the next level and solve a number of problems (e.g. low TPS, high transaction fees, hard forks, etc.).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum DeFi is one of the biggest markets for dApp development. The growing number of Polkadot dApps heightens the problem of Ethereum chain operability as well as transaction costs. Polkadot&#8217;s scalable and interoperable environment makes it very attractive in terms of Ethereum DeFi’s future migration to Polkadot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read Also: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/which-blockchain-to-fork-to-start-your-own-cryptocurrency/">How to fork a cryptocurrency</a></strong></p>



<p>The claim has already proven its relevance through the successful implementation of new solutions like RIO Chain. It is built as a Polkadot parachain that provides ready-made tools to <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-build-a-successful-defi-project/">develop DeFi dApp</a> on Polkadot. As an alternative, you can build Polkadot dApp on Substrate-based chains or deploy smart contracts to Moonbeam or Edgeware. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1400" height="349" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/polkadot.jpg" alt="how to launch a project on polkadot" class="wp-image-7558"/></figure>



<p><em>We will explain how to develop and launch your dApp project on Polkadot in the following sections of this article.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Initial integration with Polkadot&nbsp;</h2>



<p>From our experience, <strong><em>we can define the following types of possible launch on Polkadot:</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#BUILDING-A-PARACHAIN-TO-POLKADOT">Building a parachain for Polkadot</a></strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="#DEVELOP-A-DAPP-ON-POLKADOT">Building dApp on Substrate-based blockchain</a></strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="#CREATE-A-CROSS-CHAIN-BRIDGE-TO-THE-POLKADOT-ECOSYSTEM">Creating a cross-chain bridge</a></strong> (from your current solution to one of Polkadot’s parachains)</li>
</ol>



<p>Those are generalized examples combining a long list of possibilities into three main groups. We would like to share more technical aspects regarding each type next.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Blaize’s team of blockchain developers has been studying the unique technical specifications of the Polkadot ecosystem for a few years. We are currently working on several projects to launch on the network in the near future. <a href="https://twitter.com/blaize_tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Follow Blaize</a> news updates to see future case description in detail.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="BUILDING-A-PARACHAIN-TO-POLKADOT">Building a parachain to Polkadot</h2>



<p>Before considering this approach and starting parachain development, <strong><em>let’s define what a parachain is</em></strong> and why it is different from running an independent blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polkadot provides a highly scalable and secure ecosystem of blockchains. Yet, those blockchains are actually parachains. The main difference between them lies in <strong>shared security</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any created parachain has to be connected to the Relay Chain (the main chain of Polkadot). Along with this connection, the Relay chain will provide the parachain security and a guarantee of secure cross-chain communication (<a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-transport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCMP</a>) between all connected parachains in the system. <em>Thus, the Polkadot ecosystem ensures the desired interoperability and scalability of all chains together.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot Parachain Development</strong></h2>



<p>There is a claim that creating a Polkadot parachain requires a strong knowledge of Substrate. Substrate as well as Polkadot are written in the Rust language. Consequently, you can implement parachain development in Rust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From another perspective, generally, you can implement a custom blockchain development in any language (C++, Go or Java). If a certain interface is respected you can connect it as a parachain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, in order to ease development, Polkadot provides PDKs (which stands for Parachain Development Kit). Currently, there are two functioning PDKs which are <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Substrate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cumulus</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parity Substrate is a cutting-edge solution that allows for building a complex blockchain architecture within a short period of time. This reduces Polkadot development time significantly from years to weeks. So we recommend using the ready-made Substrate framework for building a parachain instead of writing initial <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/5-best-programming-languages-for-blockchain-development/">coding</a> in Rust, Go, or others.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><em>Previous working experience with Substrate will be a huge plus. Get to know more about the Substrate framework and its characteristics in <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development/#PARITY-SUBSTRATE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Blockchain Platforms comparison</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>The basic set of tools for Polkadot parachain development:</em></strong></h4>



<ul>
<li>Substrate 2.0.0.</li>



<li>Polkadot source code&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WASM interpreter</a> and compiler to WASM</li>



<li>Rococo&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The first step is to set up the latest version of the Substrate framework. The best way is to use Parity Knowledge Base. As soon as the environment is prepared, we can start to modify the live version of the parachain template code. The initial code can be taken from the Polkadot repository <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/roadmap/implementers-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/6d8df098600232750cc677f9d8617649.js"></script>



<p>Substrate technology contains all the necessary modules and frames for an independent chain development. But it does not have the required compatibility feature with Polkadot.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Therefore, as soon as the main chain architecture is done, you need to start using the </strong><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cumulus</a><strong> library. </strong>Cumulus will add the required parachain code while importing a Substrate-based chain to the library. Thus, it makes it compatible with the Polkadot environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to check a new-build parachain, we need a testnet examination. One of the major Polkadot testnets, <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://rococo-rpc.polkadot.io#/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rococo</a>, has been created to meet the specifications of <em>parachains testing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After testing you will need a parachain slot to deploy your chain and connect to the Relay chain. The project will need to acquire one of the parachains’ slots in the auction that will take place shortly. But take into account, you can test and deploy your parachain on <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/#KUSAMA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kusama</a> (Polkadot cousin). </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="DEVELOP-A-DAPP-ON-POLKADOT">Develop a dApp on Polkadot&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Claiming a breakthrough in operability and scalability Polkadot attracts a lot of minds eager to build dApps on Polkadot within its network. It is especially attractive for open finance developers seeking to create a full market of DeFi on Polkadot (read about <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/top-notch-defi-derivatives-you-should-know-about/"><strong>DeFi derivatives</strong></a>).</p>



<p>The first thing you should know is that the Polkadot Relay chain itself does not support any Polkadot smart contract framework. However, the arbitrary state transitions inserted into parachains do offer such support. This technology will be released shortly and will allow for building dApps on a Polkadot parachain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read Also: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/amm-solutions-to-impermanent-loss-and-front-running/">How to Avoid Impermanent Loss and Front-running Problem in DeFi</a></strong>.</p>



<p>For now, it is recommended to use one of the existing technologies and prepare your future Polkadot dApp to be ready when the parachain starts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smart contracts are a core for any decentralized application development. The Polkadot system is very complex and tiered, but there are a few ways to deploy smart contracts on Polkadot:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Develop smart contracts in any language compiled to WASM (Java, Go, etc.)</li>



<li>Develop dApp using Substrate EVM pallet&nbsp;</li>



<li>Develop dApp using Substrate <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ink</a> contracts pallet&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We will use the third approach to provide an example of dApp development for smooth integration with a Polkadot parachain in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Example of dApp development on Substrate-based chain&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Due to wider adoption of Substrate and its growing demand, we would like to show the example of using Substrate FRAME for building a dApp for Polkadot.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>The basic set of tools for (Polkadot) dApp development:</em></strong></h4>



<ul>
<li>Substrate 2.0.0.</li>



<li>Rust</li>



<li>!Ink</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WASM interpreter</a> and compiler to WASM</li>
</ul>



<p>Substrate FRAME is a code library storing ready-made modules (or otherwise pallets) to build your custom blockchain with Substrate. To create a decentralized app on top of it, one needs to combine chosen modules into the “runtime” of the framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to enable smart contract functionality we should add a <em>_contracts </em>pallet. </p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/420c26142b5e94a895a50f0341716896.js"></script>



<p>For customization, we can add all necessary imports and dependencies, develop on Polkadot custom traits within this pallet or even add more custom pallets and start the configuration.</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/26eafdb3bc3ffcfcaa0b2b66dc655df0.js"></script>



<p>After that, you can think of deploying Polkadot smart contracts for your dApp to the live environment. Currently, there are two leading solutions that offer smart contracts running via the Polkadot environment: Moonbeam and Edgeware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edgeware is a Substrate-based chain that will connect to the Relay Chain as one of the Polkadot parachains in the near future. It enables smart contracts on Polkadot to run with its further compilation to WASM. Edgeware is a perfect solution to try out the contracts made with the contracts’ pallet from the Substrate FRAME library.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In case you have chosen the Substrate EVM pallet, think of a Moonbeam smart contract solution. It uses an interoperable layer containing the current Ethereum toolset called <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier</a>. The Moonbeam platform will support all application contracts written for the EVM environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em><span class="has-inline-color has-primary-red-color">Read more detailed information about Moonbeam and Edgeware projects in <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Projects on Polkadot</a>.&nbsp;</span></em></strong></h4>



<p>To underline, <strong>you can deploy smart contracts on Polkadot only using one of its parachains.</strong> Though you can build your custom dApp on your own Substrate-based node.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, consider trying any of the smart contract solutions for Polkadot detailed above.&nbsp;Read: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/ethereum-based-dapp-development-for-trading-platform/">Ethereum dApp Development Guide</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="CREATE-A-CROSS-CHAIN-BRIDGE-TO-THE-POLKADOT-ECOSYSTEM">Create a cross-chain bridge to the Polkadot ecosystem</h2>



<p>Building a cross-chain bridge is the other way to connect to the Polkadot ecosystem. There are basically two options: create a bridge for your current solution, or provide bridge-as-a-service between two existing decentralized protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a technical point of view, a cross-chain bridge is an app for a token “transfer” between two blockchains. The transfer is made through smart contracts on both sides of the bridge and a decentralized network of independent validators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>The cross-chain bridge idea implies that tokens are moving (or transferring) between chains or protocols. But in fact, when a money transfer request occurs, the contract burns tokens on one chain and mints them on the other.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">There is a feature when the contract locks tokens instead of burning them if the initial token contract does not provide a <em>burning function. </em>Those specifications might be hard to detect for a less experienced blockchain developer. Read <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-choose-a-reliable-blockchain-company-for-your-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to find experienced blockchain developers</a> to create a solid project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to make any transaction, the contract needs a signature from a subset of validators that run the bridge. That is why the bridge is quite similar to the way a multisig contract functions. When a money transfer request goes to one of the contracts, the relayers (validators) ought to create a vote on this transaction and approve token minting on the opposite side of the bridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read also:<strong> <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/amm-types-differentiations/">AMMs models</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building a bridge using Substrate&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The Substrate framework provides a full collection of components and pallets for building bridges. The full documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bridges-common" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example, we will build a relay bridge from Ethereum to Polkadot. We decided to use !Ink because it is the primary language for smart contracts on Substrate. As an alternative, we may use Rust with no inconvenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-primary-red-color"><em>Relay bridge components:&nbsp;</em></span></strong></p>



<p><strong>01 Smart contracts&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>As we have mentioned before, we should create smart contracts on both sides of the bridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>02 Substrate pallets</strong></p>



<p>For cross-chain bridge implementation, we can use the following Substrate pallets: <em>syncing header</em> pallet, <em>arbitrary messages</em> pallet,<em> relayer</em> pallet.</p>



<p><strong>03 Validator program&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>One of the most important parts of this development is the validator program. This should take into account such parameters as the number of validators (relayers) and the established threshold for them. The threshold is the limit of required validators to approve the transaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in case there are five relayers for this bridge, and the threshold amount is three, the transaction will be approved after three confirmations occur with no need to wait for the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The daily limit is another substantial element of the validator’s program development. By establishing this feature you can specify the exact amount of funds that can be passed to one side per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The example of validation method for approving cross-chain transactions:</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/bb8e426669dc2da54d67832312e54b40.js"></script>



<p><strong>04 Application interface (UI)</strong></p>



<p>To interact with both sides of the bridge and the smart contracts in it, you will need a dApp. That is how the end-user will benefit from the bridge and <em>“transfer”</em> funds from one chain to another.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong><em>Thinking of creating a bridge? <a href="#post_contact">Contact Blaize</a> experts to schedule a meeting to start development ASAP!</em></strong></p>



<p>Existing Ethereum-based DeFi protocols should consider creating a cross-chain bridge to Polkadot. This type of development is faster than making a new dApp and has significant potential for possible interactions. You can create a bridge from the current solution to a Polkadot parachain as well as connect to existing Moonbeam contracts. Such projects as Akropolis, <a href="https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/private/adash47d-chainbridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainsafe</a>, and <a href="https://snowfork.substack.com/p/a-trustless-general-purpose-polkadot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snowfork</a> have already presented similar cross-chain solutions. </p>
