										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly become a cornerstone of modern technology, driving innovation across industries ranging from healthcare to finance, and transforming the way businesses operate. In 2023, the global AI market was valued at approximately $207.9 billion, and it is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.2%. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1600" height="850" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Exploring-Decentralized-AI_1.svg" alt="These figures underscore the great potential of AI to reshape economies and societies in the coming years" class="wp-image-71325"/></figure>



<p>However, as AI continues to evolve and permeate every aspect of our lives, concerns about the centralization of AI technologies have intensified. Centralized AI models, typically controlled by a few large corporations, raise significant issues related to data privacy, security, and bias. For instance, over 80% of AI systems are currently owned by just a handful of tech giants, concentrating immense power and control over vast amounts of data.</p>



<p>This centralization not only creates vulnerabilities but also limits the democratization of AI technology. To address these challenges, the concept of decentralized artificial intelligence has emerged as a compelling alternative. Decentralized AI seeks to distribute the power of AI across a more transparent, secure, and equitable framework, leveraging the synergy between blockchain and AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By combining the immutable, transparent nature of blockchain with the advanced capabilities of AI, decentralized AI systems promise to enhance privacy, increase security, and democratize access to AI technologies, paving the way for a more inclusive and resilient digital future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Need for Decentralization in AI</strong></h2>



<p>As Artificial Intelligence continues to advance, the centralization of AI technologies has become a growing concern. Centralized AI systems, typically controlled by a handful of large corporations, have led to several critical issues, including data privacy risks, security vulnerabilities, and the perpetuation of biases. These concerns are not only theoretical but have manifested in various real-world scenarios, highlighting the urgent need for decentralization in AI.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="879" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Exploring-Decentralized-AI_2.svg" alt="There are various security and privacy-related highlighting the urgent need for decentralization in AI" class="wp-image-71327"/></figure>



<p><strong>Data Privacy Risks:</strong> Centralized AI systems require vast amounts of data to function effectively. This data is often stored and processed by a single entity, making it a prime target for cyberattacks and data breaches. For instance, in 2020, a significant breach at a leading AI company exposed the personal data of millions of users. Such incidents underscore the risks associated with entrusting sensitive information to centralized systems. Decentralized AI, on the other hand, allows data to remain distributed across multiple nodes (based on multi-party computation principles), reducing the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing overall privacy. Even more, scaling the zero-knowledge technology allows us to secure the data delivery pipelines &#8211; as the connection between the agent and the data provider is the most vulnerable element in the AI platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Single point of failure:</strong> Centralized AI models are inherently vulnerable to attacks because they rely on centralized servers and data repositories. A successful breach can compromise the entire system, leading to catastrophic consequences. Decentralized AI mitigates these risks by distributing the processing and storage across a network, making it more resilient to attacks. The decentralized nature of blockchain, for example, ensures that even if one node is compromised, the integrity of the entire system remains intact.</p>



<p><strong>Bias in AI Models:</strong> Centralized AI models are often developed and trained by teams with similar backgrounds, perspectives, and biases, leading to AI systems that may not be fully representative of diverse populations. This can result in biased decision-making, which can have significant negative impacts, particularly in areas like hiring, law enforcement, and healthcare. Decentralized AI democratizes the development and training process, allowing a broader range of contributors to participate. This diversity of input can help reduce biases and create more equitable AI systems.</p>



<p>To highlight the growing recognition of decentralized AI, Andrew Ng, a renowned AI researcher and co-founder of Google Brain, noted:</p>



<p><em>&#8220;AI is changing the world, but we must ensure it&#8217;s used for the benefit of everyone, not just a few. Decentralized AI could be key to this.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This perspective underscores the need for a more inclusive and secure approach to AI development, one that decentralizes power and fosters collaboration across a broader spectrum of participants.</p>



<p><strong>Democratization of AI Technology:</strong> Decentralized AI also plays a crucial role in democratizing access to AI technology. In a centralized model, the power to develop, deploy, and benefit from AI is concentrated in the hands of a few corporations. This concentration of power can stifle innovation and limit the benefits of AI to a select few. Decentralized AI breaks down these barriers by allowing smaller organizations, developers, and even individuals to participate in the AI ecosystem. This democratization not only fosters innovation but also ensures that the benefits of AI are more broadly distributed.</p>



<p>The centralization of AI poses significant risks that can be mitigated through decentralization. By distributing control and data across a broader network, decentralized AI enhances privacy, security, and fairness, while also democratizing access to this transformative technology. As AI continues to grow in importance and influence, the shift towards decentralization will be critical in ensuring that AI serves the interests of all, rather than a select few.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key Technologies Enabling Decentralized AI</strong></h2>



<p>Decentralized Artificial Intelligence is powered by a convergence of advanced technologies that together create a framework for secure, efficient, and collaborative AI systems. The two primary technologies driving this transformation are blockchain and federated learning. These technologies work in tandem to address the limitations of centralized AI, providing a foundation for decentralized AI applications that are both robust and scalable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="730" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Exploring-Decentralized-AI_3.svg" alt="Decentralized Artificial Intelligence is powered by a convergence of technologies that together create a framework for secure, efficient, and collaborative AI systems" class="wp-image-71328" style="width:1041px;height:auto"/></figure>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers</strong></h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Immutable and Transparent Data Storage: </strong>Blockchain technology lies at the heart of decentralized AI, offering immutable, transparent, and secure data storage. In traditional AI models, data is often centralized and controlled by a single entity, leading to risks of data tampering, breaches, and misuse. Blockchain addresses these issues by storing data across a distributed ledger, within the secure time-stamped blocks.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Smart Contracts: </strong>Smart contracts play a crucial role in decentralized AI by ensuring the integrity and transparency of operations. Unlike traditional systems, where trust is centralized, smart contracts enable trustless interactions. </li>
</ul>



<p>Key aspects of smart contracts in decentralized AI include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Verifiability:</strong> Smart contracts are based on a transactional principle, meaning all changes to data can be verified. Before any data is modified, it undergoes a verification process, ensuring transparency and accuracy in AI models and data updates.</li>



<li><strong>Deterministic Operations:</strong> Smart contracts ensure that operations are deterministic, meaning the outcome is predictable and protected from external interference. This characteristic ensures that any changes to AI systems, such as model updates, are reliable and verifiable, eliminating the risk of unauthorized or erroneous modifications.</li>



<li><strong>Atomic Transactions:</strong> Smart contracts enforce atomicity, meaning transactions are processed in their entirety or not at all. This property prevents partial updates, ensuring that all components of an AI model or system remain consistent. Atomicity is particularly beneficial for tracking access control, agent iterations, model states, and updates in a decentralized AI framework.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Federated Learning and Collaborative Models</strong></h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Federated Learning Overview: </strong>Federated learning is a decentralized approach to training AI models, where the model is trained across multiple decentralized devices or servers rather than relying on a single centralized dataset. This method allows the AI to learn from a wide range of data sources while ensuring that the data remains on the local devices, preserving privacy. In federated learning, each device or server trains the model on its own data and then shares the model’s updates (not the data itself) with a central server, where the updates are aggregated to improve the overall model.</li>



<li><strong>Data Privacy and Security: </strong>One of the most significant advantages of federated learning in decentralized AI is its ability to maintain data privacy and security. Since the data never leaves the local devices, the risks associated with centralized data storage &#8211; such as breaches or unauthorized access &#8211; are greatly minimized. This makes federated learning particularly valuable in sensitive sectors like healthcare, finance, and personal data management, where privacy concerns are paramount. For example, in a healthcare scenario, hospitals can train AI models on patient data without sharing the data itself, thus complying with strict privacy regulations while still benefiting from collective insights.</li>



<li><strong>Collaborative AI Models: </strong>Federated learning also facilitates the creation of collaborative AI models, where multiple stakeholders &#8211; such as companies, research institutions, or even individual users &#8211; can contribute to the development of AI without exposing their proprietary or sensitive data. These collaborative models enable a more diverse set of inputs, leading to more robust and accurate AI outcomes. By democratizing the training process, federated learning ensures that AI models are not biased by the limited perspectives of a single entity, but instead reflect a broader range of experiences and data.</li>



<li><strong>Scalability and Efficiency: </strong>Another critical benefit of federated learning is its scalability. As the number of participants in the network grows, the model becomes more robust and capable of handling increasingly complex tasks. Moreover, by distributing the computational workload across multiple devices, federated learning reduces the strain on any single server, leading to more efficient processing and faster model training times. This scalability is crucial for decentralized AI applications that need to process large volumes of data or operate in real-time environments, such as autonomous vehicles or smart cities.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Incentivization</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Token-Based Rewards:</strong> DePINs use utility tokens to incentivize participants to contribute to the network. These tokens can be earned by providing services, infrastructure, or resources, ensuring that there is a continuous motivation for participation. For instance, in decentralized wireless networks like the Helium Network, individuals earn platform tokens by providing coverage with their own hardware, such as antennas and routers.</p>



<p><strong>Economic Participation:</strong> The use of platform tokens not only incentivizes participation but also creates an economic ecosystem within the network. Participants can trade or use these utility tokens within the network, driving economic activity and sustainability. This model aligns the interests of individual participants with the overall success of the network, fostering a collaborative environment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Transparency</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Immutable Records:</strong> Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and activities within a DePIN are recorded in an immutable ledger. This transparency allows for real-time auditing and verification, reducing the potential for fraud and errors. For example, in a decentralized energy network, records of electricity use can be transparently recorded and verified to ensure no tampering. This guarantees accuracy and builds trust among participants, as they can independently confirm the authenticity of the data.</p>



<p><strong>Open Access:</strong> The decentralized nature of DePINs means that all participants have access to the same information, promoting equality and reducing information asymmetry. This openness is crucial for building trust and fostering collaboration within the network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Efficiency</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Automated Processes:</strong> Smart contracts automate many of the processes within a DePIN. These contracts trigger actions, such as payments or service provisioning, when predefined conditions are met. This automation reduces the need for intermediaries, cutting down on administrative overhead and speeding up transactions.</p>



<p><strong>Cost Reduction:</strong> By eliminating intermediaries and automating processes, DePINs can significantly reduce costs associated with infrastructure development and maintenance. For instance, in decentralized energy grids, smart contracts can automate the distribution and billing of energy, reducing the need for complex administrative systems.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resilience</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Distributed Networks:</strong> DePINs inherently possess greater resilience due to their distributed nature. In a distributed network, multiple nodes can continue to operate even if some nodes fail. This ensures continuous service availability and reduces the risk of widespread outages.</p>



<p><strong>Scalability:</strong> DePINs can scale more effectively than traditional centralized systems. As more participants join the network and contribute resources, the network’s capacity and resilience increase. This scalability is particularly important in fields like telecommunications and energy, where demand can fluctuate significantly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite the great potential of blockchain, the technology faces a fundamental challenge: solitary ecosystems. Each blockchain operates in isolation, bound by its unique protocols, consensus mechanisms, and governance models, thus impeding seamless interaction. This fragmentation hinders the fluid exchange of information and value across different blockchain networks, presenting a significant barrier to the technology&#8217;s vision of creating a decentralized, interconnected digital world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-scaled.webp" alt="Cross-chain interoperability serves as the bridge, enabling diverse blockchain networks to overcome their inherent isolation and participate in a more integrated, expansive digital economy." class="wp-image-58896" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-scaled.webp 2560w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-1568x882.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p><strong>The question of why two blockchains cannot inherently interact with each other stems from their foundational design</strong>. Blockchains are built as independent ledgers, each with its distinct governance rules, security protocols, and data structures. This autonomy ensures security and integrity within each network but also creates an environment where interoperability is not natively built-in. Traditional financial systems, in contrast, have developed standardized protocols over decades that facilitate interbank communication.</p>



<p>In the blockchain world, however, the absence of a universal standard for cross-chain communication necessitates the development of interoperability solutions. Cross-chain interoperability thus serves as the bridge, enabling diverse blockchain networks to overcome their inherent isolation and participate in a more integrated, expansive digital economy.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-fce48b7b52ce113815500ca00a66cd6a">For a deeper understanding of how blockchain networks can be connected, explore <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/blockchain-bridging-explained/">Blaize comprehensive article on blockchain bridges</a>.</p>



<p>Cross-chain interoperability, then, becomes the critical solution. It represents the technological capability that enables disparate blockchain networks to communicate, share resources, and transfer value. This breakthrough overcomes the inherent limitations posed by isolated blockchains and amplifies the utility, efficiency, and scalability of blockchain applications. By bridging these divides, cross-chain interoperability fosters an ecosystem where information and assets flow freely, unlocking new opportunities for collaboration and innovation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is Cross-Chain Interoperability so Important?</h2>



<p>Cross-chain interoperability is not just a technical achievement but a vital component for the future scalability, versatility, and adoption of blockchain technologies. This interconnectedness allows for the creation of sophisticated, decentralized applications that can leverage the unique strengths of multiple blockchain platforms, thereby enhancing user experience, efficiency, and utility.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1525" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-scaled.webp" alt="Cross-chain interoperability is an essential component for the future scalability, versatility, and adoption of blockchain technologies." class="wp-image-58895" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-scaled.webp 2560w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-1536x915.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-2048x1220.webp 2048w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-1568x934.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>The significance of cross-chain interoperability extends beyond mere asset transfer. It is foundational for achieving a truly decentralized and collaborative digital ecosystem. By enabling blockchains to interact without intermediaries, it fosters an environment where innovation can flourish, unhampered by the technological and philosophical divides that currently segment the blockchain space. This cross-communication capability ensures that blockchain technology can move towards a future where financial systems, supply chains, and digital identities are interconnected, providing a level of interoperability that matches, or even surpasses, that of current centralized systems.</p>



<p>Moreover, interoperability addresses one of the blockchain industry&#8217;s pressing challenges: network silos. It does so by enabling a fluid exchange of value and data across different blockchain networks, which, in turn, can lead to an increase in liquidity, improved security protocols through shared intelligence, and the creation of new markets and business models that were previously inconceivable. Projects and platforms that embrace cross-chain technology are at the forefront, driving the industry towards a more integrated, efficient, and user-centric future.</p>



<p>This is the vision that cross-chain interoperability promises, and its importance lies in several key areas:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Benefit:</strong></td><td><strong>Description:</strong></td><td><strong>Example:</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enhanced DeFi Experience</strong></td><td>Currently, DeFi applications are largely restricted to the blockchain they&#8217;re built on. Cross-chain interoperability allows users to access a wider range of DeFi protocols and services, regardless of the underlying blockchain. Imagine seamlessly transferring your funds from a high-yield savings protocol on Ethereum to a lending platform on Solana for better interest rates.</td><td>Cross-chain interoperability protocols (CCIPs) like CCIP crypto: CCIP Explorer facilitate secure cross-chain communication, enabling innovative DeFi applications that leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Increased Liquidity</strong></td><td>Fragmented liquidity across different blockchains hinders overall market efficiency.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are Blockchain Interoperability Solutions?</h2>



<p>Imagine a world where different blockchains, each with their own strengths and functionalities, could seamlessly exchange information and assets. This interconnected future is what cross-chain interoperability promises to deliver. But how exactly do we achieve this communication between isolated blockchains? Let&#8217;s delve into the various solutions that are breaking down these barriers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="http://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/blockchain-bridging-explained/(opens in a new tab)">Cross-Chain Bridges</a></strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-scaled.webp" alt="Cross-chain bridges act as intermediaries between blockchains, facilitating the secure transfer of assets and data." class="wp-image-58893" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-scaled.webp 2560w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-1568x882.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>Cross-chain bridges act as intermediaries between blockchains, facilitating the secure transfer of assets and data. These bridges typically lock assets on the originating chain and mint an equivalent representation on the destination chain. When the user wants to return the asset, the bridge burns the representation on the destination chain and unlocks the original asset on the originating chain.</p>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Wormhole: Wormhole is a generic cross-chain bridge protocol that facilitates asset transfers between various blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche.</li>



<li>Multichain (formerly AnySwap): Multichain is a popular cross-chain bridge solution supporting a wide range of blockchains, known for its user-friendly interface and fast transaction times.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-f023c285532941a5ce14977beeb8d08f"><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-launch-a-project-on-polkadot-dapp-parachain-and-bridge/">Read Also: Blaize comprehensive guide on how to launch a dApp, bridge and parachain on Polkadot</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shared Validators</strong></h3>



<p>Shared validator protocols leverage a set of validators who participate in securing both blockchains. These validators are responsible for verifying transactions on both chains, creating a trustless environment for communication and data exchange.</p>



<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>More efficient than traditional bridges: Shared validator protocols can be more efficient than traditional cross-chain bridges as they don&#8217;t require locking assets.</li>



<li>Potentially lower fees: Transactions involving shared validator protocols may incur lower fees compared to bridge transactions.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Requires coordination between blockchains: Implementing shared validator protocols requires a high degree of coordination between the participating blockchains.</li>



<li>May not be suitable for all types of communication: Shared validator protocols might not be ideal for all types of cross-chain communication, particularly for complex data transfers.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Cosmos Hub: connects several subchains via Cosmos IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication). IBC can leverage shared validator sets between Cosmos-based blockchains to facilitate secure and efficient communication.</li>



<li>Polkadot parachains: Polkadot utilizes a shared security model where validators securing the main relay chain (Polkadot) can also participate in securing parachains (application-specific blockchains) connected to the relay chain.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Light Clients &amp; Oracles</strong></h3>



<p>Light client protocols and oracles form a powerful duo for achieving blockchain interoperability. These light clients reside on another blockchain and can efficiently communicate with the main chain. Think of oracles as information bridges. They act as trusted intermediaries, retrieving data from the source blockchain (where the light client resides) and relaying it to the target blockchain. This allows the target blockchain to verify the information without needing to download the entire history of the source chain.</p>



<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Efficient and Scalable: Light clients are compact and require minimal resources, making them ideal for frequent data transfers. This scalability is particularly beneficial for applications requiring real-time data feeds from multiple blockchains.</li>



<li>No Locked Assets: Unlike bridge solutions, light clients don&#8217;t require users to lock up their assets on a separate platform. This eliminates the risk of centralization associated with bridges.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Relies on the Trust of Oracles: The security of the entire system hinges on the reliability of oracles. Malicious or compromised oracles could potentially feed false information into the network.</li>



<li>Potential Data Manipulation Risks: Since oracles act as intermediaries, there&#8217;s a possibility of data manipulation if they&#8217;re not carefully designed and implemented.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the ever-evolving world of blockchain technology, the concept of <em>blockchain bridges</em> has emerged as a critical solution for creating and enhancing cross-chain interoperability across diverse networks. Blockchain bridges emerge as a perfect solution to the fragmentation dilemma. These protocols operate as secure, trust-minimized conduits, traversing the chasms between isolated networks and enabling the frictionless exchange of assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To better understand the essence of blockchain bridges, imagine:</p>



<p><strong><em>Problem</em>:</strong> A gaming company A on the Ethereum network, and company B, operating on BNB Chain, have users who want to trade digital assets between these two distinct blockchains. However, direct asset exchange is only possible due to compatible protocols.</p>



<p><strong><em>Solution</em>:</strong> A blockchain bridge is introduced, connecting Ethereum and BNB Chain. It allows Company A players to securely trade their Ethereum-based assets with Company B users on the BNB Chain. Assets are &#8216;locked&#8217; in a smart contract on one blockchain and an equivalent asset is &#8216;minted&#8217; on the other, facilitating seamless cross-chain asset trading.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="626" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_2-_3_.webp" alt="The concept of blockchain bridges has emerged as a critical solution for creating and enhancing cross-chain interoperability across diverse networks" class="wp-image-53704" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_2-_3_.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_2-_3_-1536x601.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_2-_3_-1568x613.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>In the absence of bridges, crypto assets remain tethered to their native networks, unable to participate in other ecosystems being ‘isolated’. This fragmentation stifles liquidity, impedes DeFi adoption, and ultimately limits the scope of crypto&#8217;s revolutionary potential.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-1903d97ba7de4d91972acc609308abe3">With over 25 blockchains in our comprehensive expertise and countless bridge cases, we&#8217;ve accumulated real-world experience and insights. In this article, we&#8217;ll not only explain the technical intricacies of bridges but also share our practical experience in the domain. So let&#8217;s dive in!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are Blockchain Bridges</h2>



<p>Blockchain bridges are protocols that facilitate the transfer of assets and data between different blockchains. They act as intermediaries, navigating the technical and security complexities of disparate networks to enable the frictionless flow of value. This cross-chain interoperability unlocks a wealth of benefits, transforming the fragmented crypto landscape into an interconnected system.</p>



<p>Blockchain bridges act as the architects of interoperability, seamlessly connecting previously isolated blockchain ecosystems. They enable the transfer of assets beyond simple swaps, empowering you to unlock opportunities that transcend individual networks.</p>



<p>Imagine holding ETH but discovering a lucrative DeFi yield farming opportunity on the Polygon network. Traditionally, you&#8217;d be forced to sell your ETH, incur conversion fees, and potentially miss out on fleeting market movements.</p>



<p>Bridges offer a more strategic solution. You can deposit your ETH into the bridge, which securely locks it and mints an equivalent amount of &#8220;wrapped&#8221; WETH on the Polygon network. This WETH functions identically to native ETH within the Polygon ecosystem, allowing you to participate in the desired yield farm without sacrificing your original position.</p>



<p>This scenario exemplifies the true power of bridges: unlocking diverse use cases beyond straightforward asset swaps. Whether you seek better DeFi rates, explore innovative dApps, or capitalize on arbitrage opportunities, bridges empower you to leverage the full potential of your assets across a multitude of chains.</p>



<p>Remember, while bridges offer distinct advantages, they may involve slightly higher fees compared to centralized exchanges. Additionally, their value shines brightest when seeking opportunities for the same asset across different networks. By choosing the right bridge and understanding its specific fees and functionalities, you can effectively navigate the interoperable landscape and maximize your blockchain experience.</p>



<p>This is just one example of the transformative power of blockchain bridges. Their impact extends far beyond individual user convenience, fostering a more efficient digital economy:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DeFi Growth</strong>: Bridges empower users to access and optimize DeFi protocols across multiple networks, maximizing yield opportunities and diversifying risk.</li>



<li><strong>Liquidity Liberation</strong>: Trapped assets gain freedom, injecting crucial liquidity into decentralized exchanges and fostering efficient price discovery across diverse token ecosystems.</li>



<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Unfettered asset flow fuels the development of next-generation cross-chain applications and protocols, leading to unprecedented levels of collaboration and innovation within the cryptosphere.</li>
</ul>



<p>Blaize has prepared a comprehensive guide on <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/cross-chain-interoperability/">cross-chain interoperability</a>, explaining its pros and cons and considering several real-life examples. The article is already available under the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/cross-chain-interoperability/">link</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Do Blockchain Bridges Work</h2>



<p>Blockchain bridges employ advanced mechanisms to ensure secure and efficient cross-chain interactions. These methods vary but primarily include the <strong>Wrapped Asset Method</strong> and the <strong>Liquidity Pool Method</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="638" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_3-_6_-копія.webp" alt="Blockchain bridges employ advanced mechanisms to ensure secure and efficient cross-chain interactions." class="wp-image-53705" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_3-_6_-копія.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_3-_6_-копія-1536x612.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_3-_6_-копія-1568x625.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wrapped Asset Method</strong></h3>



<p>This approach involves &#8216;wrapping&#8217; an asset from one blockchain into a token on another blockchain. This wrapped token represents the same value and can be unwrapped back into the original asset, ensuring asset portability across blockchains.</p>



<p>The wrapped asset method adopts a custodian-like approach, safeguarding your original asset while facilitating its interaction on the target chain.</p>



<ul>
<li>Escrow of Origin: When you initiate a bridge transaction, your native asset gets deposited into a dedicated smart contract on the source chain. This smart contract acts as a secure vault, locking your asset out of circulation and guaranteeing its return upon redemption.</li>



<li>Mirror Image Minting: Concurrently, on the target chain, an equivalent amount of &#8220;wrapped&#8221; tokens is minted. These tokens, pegged 1:1 to your original asset, function seamlessly within the target network, granting you access to its DeFi protocols, exchanges, and dApps.</li>



<li>Unwrapping the Value: To return home, you submit a redemption request on the target chain. Upon verification, the corresponding wrapped tokens are burned, and the smart contract on the source chain releases your original asset, completing the safe passage back to its native realm.</li>
</ul>



<p>While prioritizing security with its escrowed custodianship, this method introduces a degree of centralization. The smart contract holding your assets becomes a potential vulnerability, and its design and operational security become paramount considerations</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquidity Pool Method</strong></h3>



<p>In this method, liquidity pools are used to facilitate asset transfers. Users deposit assets into a pool on one blockchain and receive an equivalent value on another blockchain. This ensures liquidity and seamless transfers across different networks. Instead of individual copies, the liquidity pool method envisions a constantly flowing river of cross-chain value.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Contributing to the Flow: </strong>To initiate a bridge crossing, you deposit your native asset into a liquidity pool on the source chain. This pool, governed by smart contracts, dynamically manages the total value locked on both sides of the bridge, ensuring a balanced ratio of native and wrapped tokens.</li>



<li><strong>Swapping with Precision:</strong> By exchanging your tokens within the pool, you trigger the automatic minting or burning of wrapped tokens on the other side, effectively swapping your asset&#8217;s native form for its cross-chain doppelganger. Smart contracts ensure precise exchange rates and maintain sufficient liquidity in both pools.</li>



<li><strong>Maintaining Equilibrium: </strong>To guarantee the bridge&#8217;s smooth operation, advanced algorithms constantly adjust the pool sizes on both sides, balancing supply and demand. This dynamic equilibrium incentivizes user participation and rewards liquidity providers for contributing to the bridge&#8217;s functionality.</li>
</ul>



<p>While offering a more decentralized approach, the liquidity pool method introduces considerations like potential price slippage (temporary deviations from desired exchange rates) and impermanent loss (risks faced by liquidity providers due to changing pool ratios).</p>



<p>By understanding these intricate mechanisms, we gain a deeper appreciation for the technological prowess of blockchain bridges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of Blockchain Bridges</h2>

<p>In this environment of heightened risk, unwavering vigilance and uncompromising security measures become non-negotiable imperatives. The potential consequences of a breach transcend mere financial losses; reputational ruin and a shattered sense of trust within the broader ecosystem loom large. Bridges, therefore, must stand as fortresses, meticulously fortifying their defenses against the relentless onslaught of cyber threats.</p>



<p>This section delves into the critical security considerations for blockchain bridges, exploring the intricate strategies and unwavering vigilance required to safeguard the very foundations of interoperable finance. By understanding the potential vulnerabilities and the essential safeguards, we can collectively strive towards a future, fostering innovation in finances.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s explore some key ways to fortify the bridge landscape:</p>



<p><strong>1. Smart Software Design:</strong></p>



<p>Centralization as well as decentralization face vulnerabilities – centralized bridges can have single points of failure if key management or governance is flawed, while decentralized bridges often rely on relays or oracles that, if compromised, could disrupt operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The true key lies in impeccable software design. Eliminate single points of failure regardless of the governance model, be it through multisig wallets, secure key storage, and distributed governance in centralized bridges, or robust oracle networks and fault-tolerant relay infrastructure in decentralized ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, security stems not from the system&#8217;s structure, but from its meticulous and vulnerability-free design.</p>



<p><strong>2. Bandwidth Management:</strong></p>



<p>To guarantee a smooth user experience and prevent congestion, bridges must tackle scalability and high availability. This means efficient bandwidth management, regular DDoS vulnerability assessments, guaranteeing constant availability of relay/validation services, and implementing robust failover procedures for validator failures. By addressing these elements, bridges become resilient arteries, handling increasing demand while ensuring uninterrupted cross-chain activity.</p>



<p><strong>3. Smart Contract Audits:</strong></p>



<p>The bedrock of any bridge&#8217;s security lies in its meticulously crafted smart contracts. Engaging reputable auditing firms to conduct thorough vulnerability assessments is crucial. Look for bridges like Ren, which have undergone multiple audits by esteemed crypto security experts, providing users with enhanced confidence in the code&#8217;s integrity.</p>

<p>Sui and Aptos, each with their unique features and capabilities, have positioned themselves as game-changers in the blockchain arena.</p>



<p>As the global cryptocurrency market is <a href="https://ir.citi.com/gps/MG9DEWhoYvQJVWLM9Kr3%2BZmqjoztKJcyNHr83F9Wug2pzAGHPQKfp23RAMrkNts%2FJitXoTNqufOvegUjjXh0IA%3D%3D">projected to reach a staggering $4.94 trillion by 2030</a>, the competition between these two powerhouses has investors, developers, and enthusiasts on the edge of their seats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to choosing the right blockchain technology, a lot of features and factors must be considered.</p>



<p>In this article, we will explore the similarities and differences between Sui and Aptos&nbsp; blockchains, delving into various aspects such as programming language, consensus mechanism, architecture, security, privacy, ecosystem, scalability, tokenomics, and funding. By the end of this article, you will have a clearer understanding of which blockchain suits your needs best.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="600" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image.png" alt="Sui and Aptos, each with their unique features, have positioned themselves as game-changers in the crypto industry." class="wp-image-32917"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Similarities of Aptos and Sui</h2>



<p>Both Aptos and Sui blockchains are designed to address the scalability and efficiency issues faced by the current generation of blockchain networks. They both implement one of the most advanced programming languages &#8211; Move, utilize parallel execution for high throughput (TPS), and offer low latency. These similarities make them attractive options for businesses looking to build blockchain-based applications.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong>Blaize has already considered the topic of choosing suitable blockchain technology for running your project. Feel free to discover our advice </strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-choose-the-right-blockchain-network-for-your-dapp-development/"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Aptos vs. Sui: Detailed Comparison</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Programming Language</strong></h3>



<p>The language used for parallel execution in both Aptos and Sui is Move, which is based on Rust and was initially designed at Meta. The language offers powerful tools and features to build smart contracts and decentralized applications. However, Sui has its own version of the language.</p>



<p>Aptos follows the standard design outlined in Diem&#8217;s whitepaper, while Sui has a slightly different object model. Sui&#8217;s storage system is object-centric, which means that most things on the blockchain, including addresses and transactions, are represented as objects.</p>



<p>Sui&#8217;s version of Move clearly indicates when an object is owned, shared, mutable, or immutable, whereas Aptos does not. Additionally, Sui&#8217;s ownership API is cleaner than Aptos&#8217;s, as it provides a clearer representation of the blockchain design.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Consensus Mechanism</strong></h3>



<p>Sui and Aptos have different architectures that affect how they use distributed ledger technology. Aptos uses a blockchain to record its ledger, while Sui&#8217;s distributed ledger is a directed acyclic graph. This impacts their consensus mechanisms and scalability.</p>



<p>Aptos utilizes a variant of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), which ensures high network security and fast transaction confirmations. Sui, on the other hand, employs a novel consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), which emphasizes energy efficiency and decentralization. Sui uses an asynchronous consensus protocol called Narwhal and Bullshark, which allows for parallel execution of transactions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="668" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1.png" alt="Aptos utilizes a variant of the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), while Sui uses Proof of Space-Time (PoST)." class="wp-image-32918" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1.png 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1-1536x641.png 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1-1568x655.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Architecture</strong></h3>



<p>Sui and Aptos differ significantly in their architecture, particularly in how they utilize distributed ledger technology. Sui&#8217;s ledger is stored as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph (DAG)</a> rather than a blockchain like Aptos. While both designs are efficient and share similarities with traditional blockchains, their differences are essential to their consensus mechanism and scalability.</p>



<p>Aptos has a modular architecture that enables easy upgrades and customizations, while Sui focuses on a multi-layered architecture to separate the consensus, storage, and computation layers. This allows for improved scalability and flexibility in the network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security and Privacy</strong></h3>



<p>While it is true that Aptos and Sui have not undergone a formal audit, this does not necessarily mean that they are not secure or reliable. Many blockchain projects have been successfully launched without formal audits, and smaller projects are not uncommon to prioritize other aspects of development before seeking formal auditing.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that potential vulnerabilities or flaws in the code may not be identified without a formal audit. It&#8217;s also worth noting that the lack of a formal audit could be a cause for concern for some investors and users who prioritize security and transparency. At Blaize, we provide deep security audit services for blockchains (nodes and consensus).</p>



<p>While Move programming language offers a significant level of security by its design, it doesn’t make contracts secure by default. Secure contract development includes using modern language features while crafting the code and secure and reliable architectural design of the contract with obligatory <a href="https://blaize.tech/security/">smart contract security audit</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ecosystem</strong></h3>



<p>The ecosystems are very different and extensive in both projects. Every day there is something new to discover at both chains. It&#8217;s hard to pick out an outsider and a favorite. Aptos blockchain got its popularity before Sui, but at the moment, judging by the number of followers on Discord, Sui is overtaking Aptos.</p>



<p>After a surge in the popularity of Aptos several months ago, many various projects were created and launched exactly using that blockchain. During the year 2022, over 100 projects were developed using Aptos network.</p>



<p>The most popular projects built over Aptos include <a href="https://pontem.network/">Pontem</a> (a universal wallet) and <a href="https://pyth.network/">Pyth</a> (a modern oracle).</p>



<p>Aptos boasts a growing ecosystem of tools, libraries, and developer resources, while Sui&#8217;s ecosystem is relatively nascent but has the potential to grow rapidly as more developers join the network.</p>



<p>As for Sui, the mainnet of the network will only be launched in Q2 2023 and the testnet was launched in the last days of March 2023. Thus, the majority of the project is now TBA. One of the most remarkable Sui projects so far is Sui wallet. Still, the Sui blockchain has great potential to overtake Aptos due to its scalability level.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scalability</strong></h3>



<p>Aptos and Sui both focus on achieving high scalability through parallel execution, sharding, and other techniques, aiming to support millions of transactions per second.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a centralized validator or pursuing large-scale decentralization, both Sui and Aptos prioritize optimizing scalability by maximizing network capacity, similar to the approach taken by Solana. However, the bottleneck in achieving this goal is likely to be the growth of the ecosystem&#8217;s state.</p>



<p>To address this bottleneck, Aptos prioritizes using heterogeneous validators with constrained CPU and storage resources, while Sui plans to efficiently shard data storage and scale its resources horizontally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h3>



<p>Aptos and Sui are two blockchain ecosystems with different approaches to their tokenomics. Aptos has released an overview of their tokenomics for their native token APT, but additional information is expected to be published soon. APT is currently used for PoS participation and liquidity incentives, with an initial supply of 1 billion tokens. The majority of the initial supply is currently staked for PoS participation, with the remaining tokens allocated to different categories.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Mysten Labs has published an in-depth whitepaper on the native token of Sui, SUI. SUI will be staked within an epoch to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism and on-chain voting. Additionally, SUI will be used as the asset denomination to pay for gas fees and other operations on the Sui platform, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens. The exact allocation percentages for the distribution of tokens have not been released, but the presence of the storage fund can create monetary dynamics and reduce the amount of SUI in circulation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Funding</strong></h3>



<p>Aptos Labs has amassed a total of about $400 million in funding from a wide array of capital ventures, including Andreessen Horowitz, FTX Ventures, Jump Crypto, a16z, Tiger Global, and Multicoin Capital, among others. At present, Aptos Labs counts 28 investors among its backers.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Sui is making significant strides with its latest funding round, the Series B, which took place in September 2022. The company behind Sui, Mysten Labs, has received significant support from major investors, such as Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, and Redpoint and managed to secure $300 million in this funding round, bringing Sui&#8217;s total funding to $36 million when combined with the $336 million raised in the Series A. Sui has also announced that it currently holds a valuation of over $2 billion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Can You Get Involved With Aptos and Sui</h2>



<p>Both Aptos and Sui offer various opportunities for developers and businesses to get involved, such as incentivized testnets, hackathons, and partnership programs. By participating in these events, you can contribute to the growth of the networks, gain firsthand experience with the technology, and potentially develop innovative solutions using either Aptos or Sui.</p>



<p>Sui is well suited to projects where high transaction speeds and high levels of security are critical, as it is based on the Move language and designed to provide security when using smart contracts. Sui is also uniquely suited to the development of financial dapps such as exchange platforms and protocols, payment systems, etc.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Aptos may be preferred for projects requiring greater programming and application development capabilities, as it supports various programming languages such as Rust, C++, Python, etc. Aptos also provides more options for creating various applications, including smart contracts, dapps, wallets and provides scalability due to its architecture.</p>



<p>Thus, the choice between Sui and Aptos will depend on the specific needs of the project and the developer&#8217;s preferences.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background">We at Blaize have already shared our expertise in creating and deploying smart contracts and comparing the most popular blockchains. You can get acquainted with the topic <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-create-and-deploy-a-smart-contract-in-a-secure-way/">here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Blaize Experience</h2>



<p>At Blaize, we have worked closely with both Aptos and Sui. Our team has gained in-depth knowledge of their respective strengths and weaknesses, allowing us to provide our clients with tailored solutions based on their specific needs. We have wide experience in Aptos and Sui networks and auditing the security of various applications, from supply chain management to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. By leveraging our expertise, you can confidently choose the right blockchain technology for your business.</p>



<p>One example of a project that could be developed using Aptos is a Play-To-Earn project with a front end and backend. This project could take advantage of Aptos&#8217; low fees and fast transaction times to provide a seamless user experience for players, while the backend could use smart contracts to ensure fair play and secure payouts. Additionally, since Aptos is designed to be scalable, the platform could handle large volumes of transactions without sacrificing performance.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Sui blockchain is also built on the Move programming language and is designed to provide a secure and scalable platform for various applications, including financial transactions. One project developed using Sui is a Dutch auction, while another more significant project is a fractionalized NFT auction platform. These platforms can take advantage of Sui&#8217;s high level of security and scalability to ensure efficient and transparent processing of all transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sui blockchain features perfectly suit NFT projects (NFT marketplaces, P2E games, etc.). Moreover, Sui&#8217;s smart contracts can provide an additional layer of security to ensure fair auctions and equitable revenue distribution among all parties involved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>In conclusion, both Aptos and Sui have their unique selling points and hold great potential for businesses looking to adopt blockchain technology. However, Sui and Aptos are rapidly developing ecosystems, they’re still pretty ‘young’ compared to other big players in the industry. Thus, they are definitely expected to settle all security audit issues soon.</p>



<p>Overall, it is not possible to objectively assess one company as the best or the worst, as both are still in their early stages of development. It is important to monitor their continued success regarding their security and to consider the interests and needs of users when using their products and services.</p>



<p>A good recommendation would be to analyze as many sources of information as possible to find out the non-evident peculiarities of the projects. For instance, various forums, AMA-session recaps, etc. Both projects are truly prospective and worth consideration.</p>



<p>At Blaize, we are committed to helping you navigate the complex world of blockchain and find the best solution for your needs. We know the strong and weak points of blockchains and will definitely help you to pick a better one for your project.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Choose The Right Blockchain Technology Company</h2>



<p>If you are choosing between several blockchain software development companies and having a tough time, take a step back, relax, and try to make things a bit more clear for yourself. This is especially crucial if you have never outsourced the development process to a third party.</p>



<p>So, first of all, what you’d wanna do is create a list of the fundamental details of your project. It should include the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>the main idea of your project</li>



<li>the problem your project solves</li>



<li>Its competitive advantages – why it is better than other existing solutions&nbsp;</li>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New crypto games emerge almost every week, but only a few selected ones remain existing and growing. A critical factor behind this reality is the intricacy of tokenomics – the structure of the project’s economic and value systems; simply put, token economics.</p>



<p>The downfall of many promising games can often be traced back to poorly developed tokenomics. Consider a hypothetical web3 game, having advanced graphics and curious gameplay. Despite its initial hype, it failed to craft a sustainable economic model. The in-game currency was awarded so easily that it soon flooded the market, leading to hyperinflation and diminishing the coins&#8217; value. Players who had invested time and resources felt the sting as their hard-earned treasures lost significance, ultimately leading to a mass withdrawal.</p>



<p>And, unfortunately, this story isn’t made up. A game&#8217;s success depends not just on its entertainment value but on a robust economic system that maintains a balance between earning and spending within the digital ecosystem. As we delve into the topic of tokenomics, we&#8217;ll explore what factors are to be considered to build a strong and reliable tokenomics for GameFi project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WHAT IS TOKENOMICS?</h2>



<p>Tokenomics is one of the fundamental elements of any blockchain-based project, including games. It creates utility for the project&#8217;s token and pushes the protocol&#8217;s internal economy. From this point of view, the concept is simple &#8211; every project with a token will have its tokenomics. Either it is just a token emission, a bound of native token to in-game NFTs, or shows the generation of the player&#8217;s income &#8211; tokenomics should describe it. Investors pay special attention to this chapter of the project&#8217;s Whitepaper and mainly access the game based on its tokenomics design.</p>



<p>Today, we’ll share our experience and knowledge in this area, which will hopefully assist you in designing tokenomics for your crypto game. So buckle up, and don’t forget to save this article for easy access!</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Basic Tokenomics models</h1>



<p>Since the blockchain emerged and Bitcoin was introduced, projects have mostly used deflationary tokenomics models. Such models assume a fixed token supply with less and less money issued over time. Many famous cryptocurrencies are governed under this model, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Solana, Tron, and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, you can choose an inflationary tokenomics model when building tokenomics for your crypto game. In this case, tokens will only increase in supply, but certain mechanics will help you limit inflation or even create a deflationary system. Good examples of such a crypto tokenomics model are Ethereum, Polkadot, and Polygon, which don’t have the maximum token supply.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1020" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-1.jpg" alt="Deflationary and Inflationary tokens with examples" class="wp-image-8032" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-1.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-1-1536x979.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-1-1568x1000.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>There are several types of deflationary and inflationary tokenomics models, including the ones that maintain certain features of both. Here is a brief list of the key models of crypto gaming tokenomics:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Basic deflationary model</strong> (BTC, XRP, SOL) – The project releases a fixed number of tokens at a token generation event. Such a limited supply naturally creates demand, driving investors to purchase.</li><li><strong>Buyback and burn</strong> (BNB) – The project buys tokens back from holders and burns them, removing them from the supply and balancing the economy.</li><li><strong>Burn on transaction</strong> (SAFEMOON) – The protocol creates a special tax on transactions that is written in its smart contract. It burns the tax, removing it from the total supply, or distributes it among token holders.</li><li><strong>Net deflationary model </strong>(CRV) – Although there is no maximum token supply, the burn rate from taxes or buybacks fully compensates the issuance rate and creates demand.</li></ul>



<p>Since there is no such thing as the “right” GameFi economy, you can freely choose the tokenomics of your game that will fit the protocol best and benefit all parties.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">TOKENOMICS ANALYSIS</h2>



<p>In the realm of GameFi, tokenomics stands as an integral element, as it forms the way how both the protocol and its users get their income, and it balances the internal fund flows.. This analysis delves into the dynamics of token supply and demand, dissecting the mechanisms that dictate their flow and influence in the GameFi economy. By comprehensively understanding these elements, stakeholders can better navigate the complex interplay of factors that determine a game&#8217;s financial success and sustainability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>TOKENS SUPPLY</strong></h3>



<p>The supply side of tokenomics in GameFi is governed by intricate models and mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The deflationary model exemplifies a capped token supply, creating scarcity and potential value appreciation over time. Prominent in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, this model ensures a finite supply, akin to digital gold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversely, the inflationary model, employed by platforms like Ethereum, adopts a continually increasing supply, counterbalanced by strategies to temper inflation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Token supply in GameFi refers to the total number of tokens available within the game&#8217;s ecosystem. This supply can either be fixed or variable, depending on the game&#8217;s tokenomic model.</p>



<p>Token supply is formed through initial minting processes and can be adjusted over time via various mechanisms. These mechanisms include burning tokens or creating more through specific game events or actions.</p>



<p><strong>Factors Impacting Tokens Supply:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Minting Rules: Guidelines defining how and when new tokens are created, especially in connection to in-game rewards.</li><li>Burning Mechanisms: Processes for permanently removing tokens from circulation.</li><li>Issuance Protocols: Methods and rules for distributing tokens initially and over time.</li><li>Deflationary/Inflationary Models: Choice between a fixed supply (deflationary) or an ever-increasing supply (inflationary).</li><li>Smart Contract Regulations: Automated rules impacting token generation and destruction.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>TOKENS DEMAND</strong></h3>



<p>The demand facet in tokenomics is multifaceted, influenced by a blend of utility, security, and exclusivity. Utility tokens are more than mere currency; they unlock access to game features and services, enhancing player engagement and loyalty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Token demand in GameFi represents the desire or need for tokens within the game&#8217;s economy. It is a measure of how much players, investors, and users value and seek out the tokens.</p>



<p>Demand is shaped by the perceived utility and value of the tokens, influenced by their integration into game mechanics, rewards systems, and overall market sentiment.</p>



<p><strong>Factors Impacting Tokens Demand:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Utility and Benefits: The practical uses and advantages offered by the tokens, access tiers and subscriptions.</li><li>Gameplay Integration: The extent to which tokens are woven into the game&#8217;s mechanics and rewards.</li><li>Market Perception and Speculation: How players and investors view the token&#8217;s potential for value appreciation.</li><li>Liquidity in the Market: The ease with which tokens can be traded.</li><li>Staking Opportunities: Chances to earn more tokens or in-game advantages through staking.</li><li>Regulatory Influences: Legal and policy factors affecting token usage and trading.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Essential token mechanics</h2>



<p>To build a powerful tokenomics for a blockchain game, you should know all its elements and how they interact with each other. Moreover, it is crucial to understand what mechanics are used to create, route, and alter tokens, their advantages and flaws. Most probably, you already know that any crypto game functions with the help of smart contacts, similar to other blockchain-based systems. But what about the rest of the mechanics?</p>



<p>For you to take a deeper dive into this topic, we’ve decided to share all the details of token mechanics and its elements, even the simplest ones. If you feel like you have extensive expertise in this field, feel free to skip some parts of this chapter.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">By the way, our team of experts offers comprehensive <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/token-development-services/">token development services</a></strong>, covering everything from token creation to post-launch maintenance and support.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Coins &amp; Tokens</strong></h3>



<p>The notions of “coins” and “tokens” are pretty close in the blockchain industry and can often be used interchangeably. However, they might still imply different things, so let’s define them once and for all.</p>



<p>Both concepts may refer to an entity that is a storage of value, digital money of some kind. But, a token also represents something a holder can do or own, as a sign of ownership or access. And do not misinterpret it with utility &#8211; as both coin and token will have it. A main distinctive feature that will help you tell coins from tokens is a blockchain – coins are issued as a native asset for blockchain &#8211; part of the consensus layer, while tokens are secondary entities launched on smart contracts as part of the execution layer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic2.jpg" alt="Examples of coins and tokens" class="wp-image-8033" width="1041" height="663" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic2.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic2-1536x979.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic2-1568x1000.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1041px) 100vw, 1041px" /></figure>



<p>There are many types of tokens, including the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Utilities</strong> – tokens that can be exchanged for some utility, service, or product feature.</li><li><strong>Securities</strong> – tokens that act like equity shares, granting their holders a voting right for the company governance and/or proceeds.</li><li><strong>Non-fungible tokens</strong> (NFTs) – unique assets, including pieces of art, digital land, game awards, etc. NFTs play a huge role in tokenomics for blockchain games. By the way, our team provides <a href="https://blaize.tech/nft-development-services/"><strong>NFT development services</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Fungibility</strong></h3>



<p>Fungibility is the feature of a token that defines how it can be exchanged with other tokens. It is one of the basic attributes of any asset, which simplifies trade and enables token swap.</p>



<p>According to this criterion, all tokens can be divided into fungible and non-fungible (NFTs).</p>



<p>Fungible tokens are the ones that can be easily exchanged without loss of function or value. On the other hand, non-fungible tokens are unique assets that store specific metadata that makes them distinguishable from other tokens and eliminates the possibility of a token swap.</p>



<p>Due to their essence, fungible tokens make great in-game currencies – users can trade or spend them anytime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, NFTs are usually used as gaming items like armor, avatars, weapons, equipment, etc. Since they are non-fungible, users can’t exchange them for other NFTs, but only sell on a secondary market or a built-in marketplace. NFTs play a huge role in tokenomics for blockchain games. You may also like <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/analysis/how-to-develop-your-own-nft-platform-in-2023/"><strong>NFT platform development</strong></a> guide.</p>



<p>While speaking about fungibility, it’s important as well to mention the utility tokens – tokens that can be exchanged for some utility, service, or product feature.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Buyback and burn</strong></h3>



<p>The buyback-and-burn mechanism in the crypto industry involves the project team buying tokens back from token holders and burning them. This way, tokens are removed from the total supply, and the game economy is balanced out.</p>



<p>The whole buyback-and-burn process is encoded into smart contracts, similar to all other aspects of blockchain-based games. Thus, this process is automated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Minting</strong></h3>



<p>Minting is a process of new token creation. This can include generating new tokens in staking programs of GameFi protocols, preparing the initial token supply by the protocol owners, or emitting tokens during tokensales or in-game events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the case of an NFT, minting may mean publishing new in-game items, new unique in-game characters or even user accounts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Issuance</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-2.jpg" alt="Token issuance" class="wp-image-8034" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-2.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-2-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic1-2-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Issuance is the mechanics of distributing tokens. This might include various forms of allocation: a pre-sale, an IPO, direct purchase by players, rewards, Airdrops, etc.</p>



<p>It is a common practice to include a vesting period when issuing tokens. This way, users won’t be able to dump them right after buying, which will help stabilize the demand and token value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>6. Burning</strong></h3>



<p>Burning is the process of permanently taking the tokens out of circulation, often by completely destroying them. It is a frequent part of the tokenomic mechanics for crypto games that are built with the inflationary tokenomics model in mind since it regulates the overall token supply and prevents the token value from a rapid drop.</p>



<p>There are two main approaches to burning tokens:</p>



<ul><li>by reducing the token supply automatically with the help of a smart contract;</li><li>by sending tokens to an inaccessible wallet.</li></ul>



<p>The first, automatic, way is much more common since it enables easier protocol maintenance.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>7. Inflation</strong></h3>



<p>In the blockchain industry, inflation is somewhat different from traditional finance. It still happens when the total supply of tokens is increasing due to constant minting or issuance. However, this does not mean that the token loses its value – such a dynamic is controlled by the special mechanics of crypto tokenomics.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>8. Staking</strong></h3>



<p>Staking is the process of locking a particular amount of tokens in a wallet to help build blocks and earn rewards. Staking is a prominent feature in the tokenomics of many projects, offering a mechanism for token holders to earn rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By participating in staking programs, users can lock up their tokens for a period, contributing to the project&#8217;s liquidity and stability. In return, they receive rewards, often in the form of additional tokens, which can equate to earning interest on their holdings. These programs engage users to hold onto their tokens, thus reducing market volatility and reinforcing the token&#8217;s value over time. Staking not only benefits the individual token holder with passive income but also bolsters the overall health and functionality of the ecosystem by ensuring a steady supply of tokens in circulation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pic2-3.jpg" alt="Full process of staking step by step" class="wp-image-39248" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pic2-3.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pic2-3-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pic2-3-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>While in DeFi, staking is essential to enable block validation by those who are interested in the protocol the most, crypto games use it for a different reason. In games, staking is often used to distribute the revenue among players.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>9. Treasury</strong></h3>



<p>Treasury is a specific address that accumulates and distributes tokens according to the rules encoded in the smart contract.</p>



<p>There are various methods of token distribution when it comes to treasuries in crypto games:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Staking</strong> – Users stake tokens to get a share of the tokens from the treasury or at least a chance of a share.</li><li><strong>Player rewards</strong> – Users get tokens for their in-game achievements like winning a contest, scoring in a race, etc.</li><li><strong>Team remuneration</strong> – Advisors and developers can get their share of the tokens from the treasury, but such mechanics have to be specifically indicated in the project documentation.</li><li><strong>Liquidity</strong> – The treasury may provide tokens to ensure liquidity, regulate token price, and prevent price manipulations.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>10. Voting</strong></h3>



<p>Voting is an essential part of any decentralized system, including crypto games. Many platforms allow players to participate in the protocol’s governance by voting for particular changes with tokens. In such a way, token holders can influence the development of the game, treasury mechanics, community support, etc.</p>



<p>When you design tokenomics for a game, you should consider enabling particular community governance mechanics as it will help you turn the game into an autonomous organization and develop it in the players’ best interests.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>11. Pegging</strong></h3>



<p>Price pegging means tying the value of a token to any other asset, including cryptocurrency, fiat, and even real-world commodities such as gold. Besides, it can involve pegging a token at a certain price (e.g., $0,25, $1, $50, etc.).</p>



<p>You might have heard that USDT stablecoin is pegged to USD 1:1. This means that the price of 1 USDT will always be 1 USD since the value to crypto is tied to fiat in this case.</p>



<p>Currencies in crypto games might also be pegged to other assets because such a practice removes the aspect of volatility, allowing for stable price regardless of external conditions and certain predictability when it comes to trading.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>12. Wrapping &amp; Bridging</strong></h3>



<p>Both wrapping and bridging are ways to move assets from one blockchain to another without too much stress. With the help of a bridge, tokens can be locked on one blockchain while their new, wrapped version is created and later traded on another chain.</p>



<p>For instance, wETH (wrapped Ethereum) is an ERC-20 compatible version of ETH that can be used on other chains. wETH is pegged to ETH price, so their values are tied.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">TOKENOMICS EXAMPLES</h2>



<p>Our track of success at Blaize is showcased not just through our extensive theoretical knowledge but also through our successful real-world applications. Let’s take a closer look at Blaize case studies where our innovative tokenomic strategies have been applied to create dynamic, decentralized games. These examples epitomize our expertise in fusing advanced blockchain technology with practical tokenomics, setting new standards in the digital gaming domain. Let&#8217;s dive into these cases to understand how Blaize is shaping the future of tokenized gaming experiences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/decentralized-app-development-for-the-crypto-game/">DApp Development for the Crypto Game</a></strong></h3>



<p>This project showcased Blaize&#8217;s prowess in developing a blockchain-based protocol for the Nomo Fantasy Leagues, intricately weaving together NFTs, ERC-20 tokens, and DeFi elements. A notable aspect of tokenomics here was the use of smart contracts for NFTs representing sports players, directly linking their market value and tradeability to their real-world performance. This tokenization not only enabled users to engage in a dynamic market of buying, selling, and staking tokens but also to reap rewards in a performance-based yield pool, adding a layer of financial strategy to fantasy sports​​​​​​​​. The advanced staking system developed by our team, bound together incentives mechanism, NFTs utility and existing game mechanics. Thus, it is a perfect example of how tokenomics designed prior development and implemented in the game engages users for participation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/app-development-for-the-crypto-game-nomo-fantasy-basketball-league/">Fantasy Basketball App Development</a></strong></h3>



<p>In this iteration, Blaize demonstrated advanced tokenomics principles by upgrading contracts for the new Fantasy NBA League under the LeagueDAO’s Nomo protocol. The development of unique NFTs for each athlete, mirroring their real-world stats, was a key tokenomic feature, adding a layer of authenticity and value to each token. The blend of smart contract development and diverse technology stack resulted in a robust GameFi sports platform, where tokenomics played a central role in enabling users to actively participate in the Nomo Fantasy Basketball League using specialized Player Tokens​​.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/nft-game-development-fantasy-football-league/">NFT Game Development – Fantasy Football League</a></strong></h3>



<p>This project was a leap forward in tokenomics upgrade, focusing on developing the NFL Fantasy Football Mega League as a season-long fantasy league with team drafts represented through NFTs. A crucial tokenomic element was the management of smart contracts that underpinned the game&#8217;s structure, ensuring a fair and balanced distribution of auto-picked NFT players. This approach maintained the integrity and competitiveness of the league, emphasizing the tokenomic principle of value distribution and scarcity. The end result was a blockchain-based platform offering an immersive gaming experience, heavily reliant on tokenomics for its operational and strategic framework​​​​​​.</p>



<p>These examples illustrate Blaize&#8217;s proficiency in combining various blockchain technologies and tokenomic principles to create engaging, decentralized sports gaming platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The motivation of participants in crypto games</h2>



<p>When it comes to crypto games tokenomics, the team has to think through the motivation for several participants, not just gamers like in traditional systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, we are working with three vital parties: players, developers, and investors. In order for a crypto game to function well and retain the necessary balance, all parties have to be encouraged and remunerated on a constant basis.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For players</strong></h3>



<p>Traditional games were created and are still developed mostly with a recreational aim – players are motivated by the gaming process itself. However, it is not the case for crypto games.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic3.jpg" alt="Player's motivation in P4F and P2E games" class="wp-image-8036" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic3.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic3-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic3-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Crypto games have introduced a double motivational system:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Play-for-Fun (P4F)</strong> – Similarly to traditional games, players are motivated by leisure. It is fun for them to spend time playing a game, which is clear from the name of this type of gaming. Commonly, users also have to spend money buying the game and even while playing it.</li><li><strong>Play-to-Earn (P2E)</strong> – In this kind of games, players have monetary motivation in the first place. As they spend time in the game and achieve particular milestones, they get rewarded with tokens, which can be spent on in-game items, traded, or exchanged and withdrawn in fiat currencies.</li></ul>



<p>The most interesting part is that while P4F games’ success depends on the game mechanics, the plot, and many other factors, P2E games gain popularity with the help of players. Due to the fact that players’ income depends on the success of the game, P2E crypto games regularly become viral and grow the community much faster than traditional ecosystems.</p>



<p>And yet, there are also two types of games within the P2E sector that differ in the motivational mechanics. These are commodity grind games and content generation ones.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Commodity grind </strong>– Players need to grind the game to create commodities and earn this way.</li><li><strong>Content generation or Create-to-Earn (C2E)</strong> – Players create new content in the game, thus <a href="https://blaize.tech/blockchain-ecosystems/"><strong>developing the ecosystem</strong></a> and earning rewards. Also, they might generate external content, such as streams or videos, to spread the word about the game.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For developers</strong></h3>



<p>The second actor in any crypto game is developers, internal and external. These are key infrastructure participants since they build the game, making it appealing to players and investors.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Internal developers</strong> – The ones that are directly involved in the development process on a daily basis, including the main team, contractors, or participants of the DAO. Their motivation is pretty understandable since they mostly earn a salary and/or rewards based on their performance and game development roadmap.</li><li><strong>External developers</strong> – These are programmers who are not employed officially but motivated in a different way, usually by special monetary rewards or community recognition. Such participants are harder to motivate than internal developers, but they are also crucial to any crypto game because they make it truly decentralized.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>For investors</strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to building tokenomics for GameFi, most projects rely on investors in the first place, forgetting about other parties. However, this is probably the most diverse and, at times, overlapping role in the ecosystem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic4.jpg" alt="Types of crypto game investors" class="wp-image-8037" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic4.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic4-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic4-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>The thing is that players and developers can easily become investors, too, if they believe in the product and want to support the game development process. Their motivation, though, is pretty easy to understand – they expect to get profit and increase their capital.</p>



<p>There are several main types of crypto game investors:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Backers (Seed investors)</strong> – The ones who come early to back the development of the game and help it get released to the market.</li><li><strong>Portfolio investors</strong> – Those who are building and diversifying their portfolio. Such investors usually choose a project based on its performance and potential.</li><li><strong>Governors</strong> – The ones who invest in a game to have a word in its development and distribution.</li><li><strong>Crypto traders</strong> – Regular investors who are not that much interested in the game itself but rather in token value. Mostly, they are less picky when choosing assets, but they still perform research before investing.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Different types of tokenomic systems</h2>



<p>Even though crypto games are still quite a new industry, there are already several types of their tokenomics design. Let us explain in more detail.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Play-to-Earn</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="646" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic5.jpg" alt="P2E tokenomics based on different types of rewards" class="wp-image-8038" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic5.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic5-1536x620.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic5-1568x633.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>As we’ve mentioned before, any P2E game is based on motivating players with certain rewards. These can be native in-game tokens or NFTs, including characters, armor, weapons, pieces of land, and other equipment that can be used during gaming.</p>



<p>Usually, P2E players are best motivated with the help of tokens that can be easily exchanged for fiat currency or other assets, so liquidity is the key.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Voting and Dividends</strong></h3>



<p>Governance tokens are a common thing for crypto games. They enable voting on the game development process, introducing new features, characters, and locations, changing game mechanics, etc.</p>



<p>Often, governance tokens also allow for dividends, acting similar to traditional equity shares. In this case, token holders receive regular passive income from the treasury.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tokensales</strong></h3>



<p>Pre-sales and IPOs or ICOs are a form of fundraising that allows the core team to receive funds for game development and investors to get tokens of a promising project.</p>



<p>During a tokensale, two types of tokens are usually distributed: governance and utility ones.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Governance tokens</strong> grant voting rights and allow token holders to participate in the decision-making process.</li><li><strong>Utility tokens</strong> offer some in-game utility while not providing any shares of the company or voting rights.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>External sources</strong></h3>



<p>Different exchanges, <a href="https://blaize.tech/decentralized-application/">dApps</a>, and NFT marketplaces might also play a role in the tokenomics for games. If game tokens are listed on any other external platform, traders might purchase them, thus adding to the liquidity and increasing token value.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">How to develop the economy for your crypto game?</h1>



<p>So, wondering how to build a crypto game economy? While the journey can be intricate, diving deep into resources like our <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/services/nft-development-services/how-to-build-a-play-to-earn-p2e-game/">how to create a p2e game guide</a></strong> can be a good starting point. However, the process involves multiple stages and is best left to experts. We strongly suggest enlisting an experienced team to navigate the nuances seamlessly</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1020" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic6-1.jpg" alt="The process of building tokenomics for crypto games step by step" class="wp-image-8039" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic6-1.jpg 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic6-1-1536x979.jpg 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pic6-1-1568x1000.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 1. DEFINE THE PARTICIPANTS YOUR GAME SERVES</strong></h3>



<p>First, think through all the parties involved in the ecosystem. Will you engage external developers? What kind of investors would you like to attract, and how exactly are you going to keep them interested?</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 2. DEFINE THE MOTIVES THAT ATTRACT PARTICIPANTS</strong></h3>



<p>Second, as you know potential participants, you should define their motivation. What needs and wants do they have? How will you meet their expectations? How will you keep them involved in the gaming process when it is released?</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 3. DEFINE THE CORE MECHANICS OF YOUR GAME</strong></h3>



<p>Next, you should think about the game mechanics in detail. How will your game stand out among competitors? How will you maintain and adapt the game if necessary? How will you grow the community, and which mechanics are you going to use to make it popular?</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 4. DEFINE THE TOKENOMICS MODEL YOU WANT</strong></h3>



<p>Then, choose the tokenomics model and token functions within your game ecosystem. Will you use governance tokens or only utility ones? What will be the total token supply, if any? How will you distribute tokens, and how will you motivate the community to buy them in order to raise funds?</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>STEP 5. DEFINE CORE TOKEN DYNAMICS</strong></h3>



<p>Finally, your goal is to decide how to add tokens to the general circulation supply and get them out of there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should clearly establish the ways for players to get tokens and spend them. If there are a lot of tokens in the market and players have no way to spend them, the token rapidly loses its value as there is no reason to hold it or buy it. And vice versa, If there are not enough tokens in the market, the supply is concentrated mostly in whales’ wallets, and you lose the community.</p>



<p>As you can see, there are a lot of questions to be answered when building tokenomics for a crypto game. If you have little experience in this area, it is much easier to hire contractors who specialize in such processes and who will help you develop a popular and profitable game.</p>

<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Final thoughts</h1>



<p>Creating tokenomics for games is a complex and rather long process that requires experience and attention to detail. All the game mechanics, participants, and their motives will directly influence your game tokenomics and, thus, its performance in the market.</p>



<p>To build a successful game that is popular among players, developers, and investors, we highly recommend you hire an experienced contractor who will think through the whole ecosystem and save you a lot of headache down the line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, has opened up a world of possibilities for financial instruments, and one of the most exciting developments in this space is the emergence of DeFi derivatives projects. Its adoption is very needed for such a volatile and uncertain environment as crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, Blaize team has gathered the top DeFi derivatives project and prepared a list of protocols that successfully run the market. Find the advantages of creating a decentralized derivatives platform or see how to gain more interest and save your crypto.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><strong>Why DeFi derivatives in crypto?</strong></strong></h2>



<p><strong><em>Cryptocurrency derivatives are financial instruments that enable hedging against future possibility of price change.</em></strong> This works the same for both traditional and crypto markets. Yet, DeFi derivatives bring a few important advantages that take trading to another level.&nbsp;Read: <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/what-to-expect-blaize-predictions-of-blockchain-development-trends-in-2021/">Blockchain Technology Trends</a></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smart contract execution</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>DeFi derivatives protocols performance is completed by finest work of smart contracts. Those allow for creation of tokenized derivatives contracts without a third party intervention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See other advantages of <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/smart-contracts-with-blockchain-how-it-can-help-startups-be-more-cost-efficient/">smart contract adoption</a> in this article.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The agreements are cryptographically encoded which gives a higher level of security and mitigates malicious activities. In addition, it allows for adaptation of newer trading instruments such as leverage to the crypto market.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><em>THINKING THAT SMART CONTRACTS ARE NECESSARY FOR YOUR BUSINESS? FIND OUT MORE ABOUT </em><a href="https://blaize.tech/smart-contracts/"><em>SMART CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT</em></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></h4>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The concept of leverage and margin trading</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Margin trading is an act of buying securities (derivatives) for a borrowed money. In crypto derivatives there is a concept of leverage instead of borrowing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we all know the volatility of the crypto market is off the charts and stakeholders use this type of contracts to manage risks. On one hand, miners can use crypto derivatives to get some certainty about their future profits and for loss mitigation. On the other hand, traders use it as a speculation tool.</p>



<p>The leverage is defined as a collateral for a borrowed amount of needed assets. In order to take an x2 leverage the one needs to collateralize either crypto asset (ETH) or stablecoin (Dai) to secure the transaction in case of price falling. The collateral will be liquidated in case the price of an asset you are trading on will go down.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>An easy example of x2 leverage might be described as follows:</em> you are sure the current price of DOT will go up. You collateralized a certain amount of Dai to be able to get a x2 risk-to-return on the price of DOTs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the price goes up by $1, you will take x2 (so $2) profit as far as you have leveraged for such a rate. But in case you were wrong and the price goes down, the contract will execute your collateral in a proportion to the leveraged amount.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="800" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frame-2-1.png" alt="How the decentralized derivatives work" class="wp-image-6289" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frame-2-1.png 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frame-2-1-1536x768.png 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frame-2-1-1568x784.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption>How the decentralized derivatives work</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The possibility of leveraging is an advanced technique of margin trading which is considered a risky one. But worth noting, that in case of short term price fluctuations and such a volatile environment as crypto leverage can bring a fortune if used appropriately.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Essentially, parties trade such contracts, without having to actually own any crypto asset. Worth mentioning, there are several types of these contracts. So, let’s walk through the DeFi derivatives list and take a look at the most popular ones:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Futures</h2>



<p>DeFi futures is a kind of agreement between two parties involved that helps to determine the terms of the future deal beforehand. This agreement obliges them to buy and to sell some particular crypto asset at a given price before a specific date in the future, the so-called expiration date. One important notion is that the deal is supposed to be concluded at some defined price, the current market price is irrelevant in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Options</h2>



<p>The next classical type of contract is called DeFi options. Basically, it’s quite similar to the futures contract where stakeholders agree to make a deal at a specific price by a set date. However, there is one crucial proviso: there is no mandatory condition to purchase(call options contracts) or sell(put options contracts) an underlying asset, a stakeholder is just able to choose whether to do it or not.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="800" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frame-1.png" alt="The difference between call option &amp; put option contracts" class="wp-image-6290" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frame-1.png 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frame-1-1536x768.png 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Frame-1-1568x784.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption>The difference between call option &amp; put option contracts</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Swaps</h2>



<p>One more commonly used type of contract is perpetual swap. Like in the case with futures and options it allows you to bet on the future price movement of an underlying cryptocurrency. The main difference here is that swaps don’t include any settlement or expiration date and traders can keep their positions indefinitely. Using swaps, they’re betting on future price uncertainty without worrying about the expiration date and ready to price changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many companies see great potential and demand in this market and strive to take their place. There are a lot of platforms that provide opportunities and tools for this kind of trade. Let’s take a look at a brief overview of some of the major players.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">OPYN&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.opyn.co/">OPYN</a> is one of the most popular decentralized options platforms. Its DeFi protocol is built initially for providing crypto insurance solutions within the DeFi ecosystem. It protects users from technical and financial risks while their investments in such DeFi ecosystems as Compound and Uniswap. And using DeFi insurance on this platform people take steps to prevent the loss of their assets.</p>



<p>OPYN platform is implemented on the top of Convexity protocol. It allows users to operate with options on ERC-20 using native oTokens. And its execution is ensured by Ethereum smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The number of various decentralized investment solutions has increased recently and the market has become in need of projects that help users to mitigate risks. Also, market participants use OPYN to create put and call options as an opportunity to get income on speculations.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><em>SEE WHICH TOOLS YOU NEED FOR </em><a href="https://blaize.tech/blockchain-ecosystems/"><em>DEFI DEVELOPMENT</em></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></h4>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Synthetix&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One more <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development/">popular blockchain platform</a> for derivative trading in the space of decentralized finance is <a href="https://synthetix.io/">Synthetix</a>. This protocol issues tokenized crypto derivatives called Synths for such assets as cryptocurrencies, commodities, stocks, fiat currencies, and indexes. In essence, synthetic assets are blockchain powered financial tools that exist in the form of Ethereum based smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These contracts follow price valuations and pay participants the returns of this asset they are issued for. Synthetic derivatives are sort of digital substitutes that relieve you of the need to own an underlying asset. Moreover, their use is not limited to the Synthetix platform. The fact that Synths are issued on such a platform as Ethereum empowers you with the possibility to provide them as a liquidity into pools on various DeFi ecosystems and get rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Synthetix’s native token, SNX, works as collateral against synthetic assets minted. It means that this collateral is kept to cover potential losses users may have while trading. The platform also has its native stablecoin sUSD that is in use for paying all transaction fees. In turn, these fees are paid to the holders of SNX and miners of synthetic assets. Ultimately, all these measures incentivize the creation of Synths. broad the usage of DeFi financial tools on a wider range of assets.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hegic&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.hegic.co/">Hegic</a> protocol is DeFi trading protocol based on Ethereum blockchain and powered by liquidity pools and hedge contracts. This is an options trading platform where traders can engage for income, or provide liquidity. It means that they stake tokens in the pool in order to receive a part of settlement fees. This platform is attractive for users because they can trade without any registration and passing KYC.</p>



<p>Trading on Hegic is non-custodial which means that you don’t have to deposit your crypto at this platform. You just need to connect your Ethereum wallet. Using Hegic, you can trade put/call options for such assets as ETH and WBTC and you’re able to choose a strike price for them. As an example with other DeFi derivatives platforms, people use Hegic for both goals &#8211; price speculations and hedging positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This platform has a self-titled ERC-20 native utility token HEGIC. It ensures the distribution of commission fees between its holders. They can also leverage HEGIC tokens for the governance of the ecosystem. Token holders vote to determine rates, types of assets HEGIC supports, fee sizes, the strike price multipliers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">dYdX&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://trade.dydx.exchange/portfolio/overview">dYdX</a> is a decentralized non-custodial crypto exchange. This platform allows users to trade without any middlemen via Ethereum smart contracts and provides opportunities for perpetual, margin, and spot trading. dYdX offers 25 pairs for perpetual swap trade including BTC-USD, ETH-USD, LINK-USD, AAVE-USD, and others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s interesting is that all trades are settled on a Layer 2 solution called ZK-Rollup which dYdX has implemented with help of StarkWare platform. As you know the scalability of Ethereum Layer 1 is quite limited and this helps significantly reduce gas costs, decrease trading fees and minimize trade sizes. </p>

<p>The model of dYdX provides users with a global lending pool instead of individual borrowers and lenders making and accepting loan offers. There is a special lending pool for each particular asset and it is run by a smart contract. And all the operations can happen at any time without needing to wait for matches between two parties. The protocol has its own native token DYDX that the community uses for governance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">UMA&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://umaproject.org/">UMA</a> (Universal Market Access) is an open-source platform that seeks to provide users with versatile access to financial markets. Its decentralized infrastructure allows parties to issue derivatives on underlying assets without the need to hold these assets. On UMA you can build synthetic assets of stocks, commodities, and <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/analysis/how-to-create-your-own-cryptocurrency-from-a-to-z/">cryptocurrencies</a> in the form of self-contained financial contracts using the Ethereum blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among other products, UMA offers put/call options on any ERC-20 token. To create this type of derivative on UMA you should lock your collateral in the form of ETH, DAI or another allowed asset. Platform’s native token UMA token can be broadly used for governance within the ecosystem and voting on various improvements of the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Worth mentioning that DeFi platforms leverage special software called oracles to transact data from the real world to smart contracts. In the case with UMA, this project doesn’t rely on external oracles and uses its own one to receive the info about current prices of assets. It consists of two parts &#8211; Optimistic Oracle and Data Verification Mechanism.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mirror Protocol&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One more interesting solution is offered by Terra ecosystem. Its <a href="https://mirror.finance/">Mirror Protocol</a> allows the creation of synthetic assets called mAssets. These synths are tied to the stock market and track the price of US-based publicly traded US companies, with real-time confirmation by an oracle. You’re also able to trade mAssets in Terraswap and Uniswap liquidity pools. In order to create a new synthetic asset, you have to lock Terra’s stable coin TerraUSD as collateral.</p>



<p>The Mirror Protocol is under the governance of the community of this platform. Surprisingly, the native MIR tokens were not allocated to the team and investors. They were distributed among users as a reward for providing liquidity. And they can leverage these tokens to propose and vote on changes on the list mAssets to be minted, modifying the ratio of collateralization, and optimizing trading fees.</p>



<p><em>The world of informational technology evolves constantly and brings miraculous changes in all the industries and spheres of our lives. And the financial industry is no exception. In recent years it has been fundamentally altered with the advent of blockchain, crypto, smart contracts, and DeFi.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In the application to such conventional financial tools as derivatives, it creates tremendous opportunities that users had missed before. Along with decentralization, it revolutionized this field, lowering the threshold for investments. Now ordinary people can access huge financial markets through DeFi derivatives applications and benefit from such powerful financial instruments that used to be the privilege of professional investors.</p>
