<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Decentralized Identity Works</h2>



<p>Decentralized identity represents a significant shift from traditional, centralized identity systems by putting control back into the hands of individuals. At the heart of decentralized identity systems are Decentralized Identifiers, which are unique, self-owned identifiers that allow users to create and manage their identities independently.</p>



<p>The creation and management of decentralized identities involve several steps:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Generation of a DID:</strong> The user generates a DID along with its associated cryptographic keys. This process is typically facilitated by a DID management application or service.</li>



<li><strong>Registration on a Decentralized Network:</strong> The DID and its public key are registered on a decentralized network, such as a blockchain. This registration process ensures that the DID can be publicly resolved and verified by others.</li>



<li><strong>Issuance of Verifiable Credentials:</strong> Entities issue VCs to the user, who can then store these credentials in their identity hub. Each credential is cryptographically signed by the issuer, ensuring its authenticity and integrity.</li>



<li><strong>Verification of Identity:</strong> When the user needs to prove their identity or a specific attribute, they present the relevant VC to the verifier. The verifier uses the public key associated with the DID to cryptographically verify the credential, ensuring it has not been tampered with.</li>



<li><strong>Data Sharing and Consent Management:</strong> Users have complete control over their personal data and can manage consent for data sharing through their identity hub. They can choose to share specific pieces of information with service providers, and revoke access when necessary.</li>
</ol>



<p>This architecture of decentralized identity systems provides a robust, secure, and privacy-preserving framework for managing digital identities. By leveraging blockchain technology and cryptographic methods, decentralized identity empowers individuals with control over their personal information, ensuring a higher level of trust and security in digital interactions.</p>

Unlike traditional identifiers issued and controlled by centralized authorities, DIDs are created, owned, and managed by the individual user. These identifiers are globally unique and can be resolved using decentralized systems.</p>



<p><strong>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):</strong> Central to the security of DIDs is public key cryptography. Each DID is associated with a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key that can be shared with others and a private key that is kept secret by the owner. This cryptographic underpinning ensures that only the rightful owner of the DID can control it and sign transactions or claims.</p>



<p><strong>Verifiable Credentials (VCs):</strong> VCs are digital statements issued by an entity (e.g., an employer, university, or government) that can be cryptographically verified. These credentials can include information such as professional qualifications, identity documents, or health records. VCs enable identity verification without the need to reveal unnecessary personal information, thereby preserving user privacy.</p>



<p><strong>Identity Hubs:</strong> These are secure data storage services that interact with DIDs. Identity hubs store, manage, and provide access to personal data associated with a DID, ensuring that users have control over their data. They facilitate interactions between different decentralized identity components and allow users to share their data with service providers securely.</p>



<p><strong>Universal Resolvers:</strong> These are tools or services that can resolve DIDs across different decentralized systems. Universal resolvers ensure interoperability between various DID methods and decentralized identity systems, allowing for seamless identity verification across different platforms.</p>

<p>Surely almost any business needs a secure, transparent system to manage data. There are two options: a readily available public solution or building your private blockchain. Which one to choose and are there any pitfalls?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="859" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pic_2-_3_-1.webp" alt="Public blockchains offer a quick entry point into the blockchain world, while private ones provide optimized performance and enhanced security." class="wp-image-53897" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pic_2-_3_-1.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pic_2-_3_-1-1536x825.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pic_2-_3_-1-1568x842.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>For many businesses, the answer isn&#8217;t as clear-cut as it seems. This guide delves into the world of public and private blockchains, providing a comprehensive exploration to help you chart the best course for your company.</p>



<p>Our exploration aims to dissect the nuances between these two blockchain paradigms, considering why the choice between them is not merely technical but strategic, influenced by a company&#8217;s specific needs, operational scale, and long-term vision.</p>



<p>The decision to adopt a public blockchain or invest in a private one is significant, shaping not only the immediate operational capabilities of a business but its future trajectory in the digital ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Public blockchains offer a quick entry point into the blockchain world with established networks and protocols. However, for companies aiming for optimized performance, enhanced privacy, and bespoke solutions that align closely with their business model, a private blockchain becomes apparent.

<p>Let’s together take a closer look at the intricacies of private and public blockchains, their pros and cons, and their use cases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Blockchain?</h2>



<p>Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. Its key attributes include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>decentralization</strong>, which eliminates a single point of failure;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>transparency</strong>, allowing all participants to view the transactions; and</li>



<li><strong>immutability</strong>, ensuring that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered.</li>
</ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="679" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pic_3-_6_-копія-2.webp" alt="Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger that records transactions across multiple computers." class="wp-image-53898" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pic_3-_6_-копія-2.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pic_3-_6_-копія-2-1536x652.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pic_3-_6_-копія-2-1568x665.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>Since its emergence alongside Bitcoin in 2009, blockchain technology has evolved significantly. Today&#8217;s networks often incorporate sophisticated layers and components or even utilize alternative data exchange models beyond the traditional &#8220;chain&#8221; structure.</p>



<p>This complexity underscores the growing need for expert teams. Raising a high-performing blockchain requires multi-profile specialists who grasp these intricate layers and navigate the ever-evolving landscape. Simply put, building a secure and efficient blockchain solution demands professional prowess beyond a basic understanding of blocks and hashes.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-783d96c4a764c7fc65a223db973e7209"><a href="https://blaize.tech/for-enterprises/">Blaize has extensive expertise in developing blockchain-based solutions as well as private blockchains from scratch</a>.</p>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re considering venturing into the blockchain space or simply seeking a clearer understanding, remember: the technology has matured far beyond its initial form. Embrace its depth and complexity, and consider seeking expert guidance to unlock its true potential for your needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Types of Blockchains</h2>



<p>Understanding the different blockchain types is crucial for informed decision-making. While the underlying technology might seem similar, the access and governance models paint distinct landscapes. Let&#8217;s delve into the three main categories:</p>



<p><strong>1. Public Blockchains</strong>: These open-access networks operate without a central authority. Anyone can join, participate in transactions, and access the complete ledger. Bitcoin and Ethereum are prominent examples.</p>



<p><strong>2. Private Blockchains</strong>: Contrary to their public counterparts, private blockchains offer restricted access and permissioned participation. A single entity or a consortium governs the network, controlling who can join and interact. Examples include Hyperledger Fabric. At the same time, any open-source blockchain (like Ripple) may be forked and launched as a private one, accelerating the advantages of private and public networks.</p>



<p>Another great example of <a href="https://blaize.tech/clients/blockchain-data-hub-solution-for-r-dees-integrated-health-it-suite/">a private blockchain is one developed by Blaize for Radiologex</a>. Get to know more details about the case further in the article.</p>



<p><strong>3. Consortium Blockchains</strong>: Bridging the gap between public and private models, consortium blockchains involve a predefined group of organizations jointly managing the network. Each member retains control over its data while collaborating on shared processes. Examples include R3 Corda and Quorum.</p>



<p>Choosing the right private vs public blockchain depends on your specific needs. Consider factors like <strong>data sensitivity, regulatory requirements, desired level of control, and the nature of your collaborations</strong>. Understanding these distinctions is the first step to unlocking the transformative potential of blockchain technology for your organization.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Public Blockchains</strong></h3>



<p>Public blockchains thrive on openness and accessibility. Anyone can join and participate, fostering a level of transparency that builds trust across the entire ecosystem. This open door also fuels innovation, as anyone can contribute to the network&#8217;s development and growth. Security is another hallmark, with distributed consensus mechanisms working tirelessly to protect against fraud and unauthorized access. Additionally, public blockchains lower the barrier to entry for global economic participation, as anyone with an internet connection can join the playing field.</p>



<p>However, this very openness comes with its own set of challenges. Scalability can be an issue, particularly when dealing with large transaction volumes that can lead to slower processing times. Privacy concerns loom large, as all transactions are publicly viewable, potentially hindering the use of this technology for sensitive data. Finally, the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can create uncertainty for businesses looking to leverage this technology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Private Blockchains</strong></h3>



<p>Private blockchains operate on permissioned networks, offering businesses a safe haven for managing data and transactions with a high degree of control and privacy. Unlike their public counterparts, they cater to customization and ensure data confidentiality. Businesses define the governance rules and manage access points, ensuring compliance with industry regulations and safeguarding sensitive information. Additionally, private blockchains are designed for specific user bases, allowing for faster transaction processing compared to public chains. This scalability makes them ideal for high-volume use cases within an organization.</p>



<p>However, the very features that empower businesses with control can also be seen as limitations. The centralized nature of private blockchains, relying on a central authority, can compromise some of the decentralization benefits that public chains offer. The closed nature might hinder rapid development and innovation, as participation is restricted to authorized members. Finally, dependence on specific vendors can limit flexibility and choice for businesses looking to explore different options within the <a href="https://blaize.tech/blockchain-ecosystems/">blockchain ecosystem</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Consortium/Federated Blockchains</strong></h3>



<p>Consortium/federated blockchains bridge the gap between the public and private worlds, bringing together predefined groups of organizations in a shared network. This unique model offers a balance between control and collaboration, allowing trusted competitors or partners to work together while maintaining some control over data and operations. Transparency is ensured within the consortium, as authorized members have access to transaction details, fostering trust and accountability. Additionally, being designed for specific industry collaborations, these blockchains offer scalability and efficiency when processing transactions.</p>



<p>However, the trade-offs are worth considering. The predefined membership restricts participation to approved organizations, hindering broader ecosystem involvement and the potential for wider innovation. Managing a consortium can also be complex due to the need for multi-party governance and agreement on various aspects. Finally, similar to private blockchains, reliance on specific vendors can limit flexibility and choice for consortium members.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Comparing Public, Private, and Consortium Blockchains</h2>



<p>When comparing these blockchain types, key considerations include access control, privacy, decentralization, scalability, and governance.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Does Asset Tokenization Work? </strong></h3>



<p>Asset tokenization is a structured process that transforms the rights to a real world asset into a digital token on a blockchain. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:</p>



<p><strong>1. Asset Selection and Legal Structuring:</strong></p>



<p>The process begins with selecting a suitable asset for tokenization. This can be any tangible or intangible asset with value, such as real estate, art, or financial instruments. Legal experts must then structure the asset into a token-friendly format, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and establishing the legal framework that dictates the rights and responsibilities of token holders.</p>



<p><strong>2. Due Diligence and Valuation:</strong></p>



<p>Prior to tokenization, the asset undergoes thorough due diligence to confirm its legitimacy, value, and title. A valuation is conducted by certified professionals to ascertain the asset’s current market value, which will underpin the pricing of the tokens.</p>



<p><strong>3. Token Creation and Issuance:</strong></p>



<p>Once the legal groundwork is laid, tokens representing shares in the asset are created on a blockchain platform. These tokens are designed to be compliant with existing standards such as ERC-20 or ERC-721 on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of wallets and exchanges. The technical aspect includes smart contract creation, which will govern the tokens’ behaviors and rights, such as transfers, dividends, or voting rights.</p>



<p><strong>4. Distribution and Trading:</strong></p>



<p>Tokens are then distributed to investors through private sales, auctions, or public offerings, depending on the regulatory framework. Post-distribution, these tokens can be listed on secondary markets &#8211; specifically those that handle security tokens &#8211; allowing for trading and providing liquidity to token holders.</p>



<p><strong>5. Regulatory and Compliance Management:</strong></p>



<p>Throughout the token’s lifecycle, issuers must manage ongoing regulatory and compliance requirements. This includes reporting, maintaining investor relations, and ensuring that the trading of tokens complies with the laws of the jurisdictions where they are traded.</p>



<p><strong>6. Asset Management and Servicing:</strong></p>



<p>The issuer also takes responsibility for the management of the underlying asset, including any necessary maintenance, rent collection if it&#8217;s a property, or authenticity verification in the case of collectibles. The performance of the asset can be tracked and reported to token holders, providing transparency and trust in the investment.</p>



<p>Tokenization leverages blockchain&#8217;s inherent advantages such as immutability, transparency, and security to streamline the entire lifecycle of asset management, thereby making previously illiquid assets accessible and tradable on a global scale.</p>

<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Regulatory Compliance and Legal Framework</strong></h3>



<p>Tokenizing real-world assets involves navigating complex and often unclear legal landscapes. Different jurisdictions may have varying regulations concerning digital assets, securities, and taxation that can impact the tokenization process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="800" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pic2-2.png" alt="Tokenizing real-world assets involves navigating complex and often unclear legal landscapes depending on the specific country's laws." class="wp-image-39364" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pic2-2.png 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pic2-2-1536x768.png 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pic2-2-1568x784.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>For instance, determining the classification of tokenized assets (whether they are securities, commodities, or a new category) can affect compliance requirements. Legal challenges also include ensuring the enforceability of tokenized asset ownership and transfer in courts, considering traditional legal systems are not always equipped to handle blockchain transactions.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Proof of Ownership</strong></h3>



<p>The main problem with tokenization is that anyone can create and issue tokens. However, a tokenized asset has its legal value only if it is issued by a legal entity &#8211; or an entity that legally can confirm the proof of ownership. That is why RWAs are always closely connected with the issuance of proofs together with the asset &#8211; e.g. issuance of the on-chain certificate which confirms the asset origin and right to issue its tokenized version. It creates an additional task for blockchain engineers and legal representatives to create an acceptable form of the on-chain representation of the origin of ownership.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Technical Standardization and Integration</strong></h3>



<p>A lack of standardization across blockchain platforms can lead to interoperability issues, making it difficult for tokenized assets to be traded or managed across different systems.</p>



<p>Ensuring the technical robustness to support the tokenization of various asset classes requires developing standardized protocols and APIs that facilitate the seamless exchange and management of tokens on different blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, integrating tokenization into existing financial infrastructures without disrupting operations poses a technical hurdle.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Price Feeds</strong></h3>



<p>One of the biggest technical tasks for RWAs is the integration of up-to-date and verifiable prices for the original asset. It is the same type of problem stablecoins and other pegged assets face: how to bind the issued tokenized RWA to the price obtained from its evaluation? Stablecoins may go with Proof-of-reserve &#8211; services that confirm the supply of fiat or cryptocurrencies that back the stablecoin. Pegged assets usually have complex on-chain mechanisms based on supply/demand principles. But it becomes more complicated for the RWAs, as they are subjects of re-evaluations, auctions, share re-issuance, inflation, and other factors (especially for art or real estate). Therefore, the launch of reliable price feeds is crucial for the evaluation of each token that represents the tokenized RWA.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquidity Concerns</strong></h3>



<p>While tokenization is praised for enhancing liquidity, the nascent state of markets for tokenized assets can sometimes result in lower liquidity than anticipated, especially in the short term.</p>



<p>Liquidity is highly dependent on market depth and the presence of a broad investor base. Developing this market infrastructure is crucial to ensuring that tokenized assets can indeed be traded efficiently and without significant price impact.</p>



<h3 class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>Data Privacy and Security</strong></h3>



<p>Ensuring the privacy and security of tokenized assets is imperative, given the sensitivity of the data bound to the RWA. For example, most private collectors and art owners who decide to work with tokenization mechanisms, will not be glad to uncover themselves publicly. Thus the tokenization platform should implement a high standard of data privacy. Or, as another example, the real estate market is sensitive to internal information disclosure and has already faced a lot of fraud and “data haunting threats”.&nbsp; Therefore the platform for real estate tokenization should have a cybersecurity team ready to handle any data breaches and security incidents..</p>



<p>So, tokenization platforms must uphold cybersecurity standards to protect against hacking, unauthorized access, and fraud. Additionally, balancing transparency with privacy, especially in compliance with regulations like GDPR, is a challenge that requires sophisticated data management solutions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Tokenize Real-World Assets&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The tokenization of real-world assets transforms physical and non-physical assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, enabling ownership to be divided, verified, and traded. Here’s a structured approach to the tokenization process:</p>



<p class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color"><strong>1. Asset Evaluation</strong></p>



<p>I<strong>nitial Steps:</strong> This involves a comprehensive assessment of the market value of an asset, that has tangible value and is eligible for tokenization market value, its ownership rights, and potential to offer returns on investment.</p>



<p class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color"><strong>2. Legal Structuring and Compliance</strong></p>



<p><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Establish a legal framework following relevant securities laws and regulations. This involves consulting legal experts to structure the offering, be it a utility token or a security token, and ensuring compliance with KYC and AML requirements.</p>



<p class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color"><strong>3. Choosing the Blockchain Platform</strong></p>



<p><strong>Selection Criteria:</strong> Select a blockchain platform that aligns with the asset&#8217;s requirements in terms of security, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Consider factors such as transaction costs, community support, and availability of infrastructure/protocols that will accept tokens as liquidity or will give trading opportunities.</p>



<p><strong>Platform Examples: </strong>Public Platforms like Ethereum itself, for its extensive smart contract capabilities, or specialized platforms like Securitize or Polymath, which are tailored for securities tokenization, are commonly chosen.</p>



<p class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color"><strong>4. Launch Preparation</strong></p>



<p>This phase includes developing real-time price feed services, creating digital proof of ownership certificates, and deploying smart contracts for token management.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color"><strong>5. Token Creation and Issuance</strong></p>



<p><strong>Token Design:</strong> Define the characteristics of the token: total supply, and divisibility (as a limit of fractionalization), connection with ownership certificate, minting rules, and rules for redeeming RWA or its value. Decide on the rights and benefits that token holders will receive.</p>



<p><strong>Minting Tokens:</strong> This process creates a specified number of tokens, which represent shares in the asset&#8217;s value. This is a crucial point, as minting follows rules for the initial supply and initial offering, defines the responsible roles or mechanisms for future minting stages, etc.</p>



<p class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color">6<strong>. Distribution and Trading</strong></p>



<p><strong>Launch:</strong> Distribute tokens to investors through a public offering, private placement, or other distribution methods. Utilize cryptocurrency exchanges or specialized trading platforms for secondary trading.</p>



<p><strong>Secondary Market:</strong> Establish a presence on secondary markets to enhance liquidity and provide investors with a platform to buy and sell tokens.</p>



<p class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color"><strong>7. Ongoing Asset Management and Reporting</strong></p>



<p><strong>Asset Servicing:</strong> Implement a robust asset management system to handle investor relations, reporting, and compliance monitoring post-tokenization.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency: </strong>Regularly provide token holders with transparent reporting on asset performance, management decisions, and financial results.</p>



<p class="has-primary-red-color has-text-color"><strong>8. Exit Strategy</strong></p>



<p><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Develop an exit strategy for investors, which may include buy-back options, token burn mechanisms, arranging for a third-party acquisition, or even full redemption of the original RWA to the new owner.</p>



<p>This structured approach to tokenization ensures that each phase is executed with diligence, from asset selection through to the management and potential exit strategies. It is essential to engage with legal advisors, blockchain experts, and financial consultants throughout this process to ensure the tokenization of real-world assets is performed with professional rigor and strategic planning.</p>

Our adept team navigates complex tokenization processes, offering end-to-end solutions that are both scalable and secure. Post-deployment, we deliver ongoing support to respond to evolving market demands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Explore our detailed case studies for a deeper understanding of our methodical approach and successful implementations of RWA tokenization principles.</p>



<p>As the most vivid example of our work with RWA tokenization, let&#8217;s mention the project on tokenizing luxury goods, with premium watches as the first phase assets. Unfortunately, the case is under NDA, but we can disclose the main challenges we faced.</p>



<p>The first problem was confirming ownership. How do we ensure the confirmation of ownership of an expensive watch? In our case, the client had an arrangement with a bank: the client acts as a platform for issuance, and the bank acts as a legal mediator to confirm ownership. A platform user who wants to tokenize his luxury goods contacts the platform, the platform transfers those goods into the bank&#8217;s depositary cell, and the bank issues a digital confirmation of the goods being stored with a connection to the owner. Our team’s first task was the creation of the on-chain representation of this certificate as proof of ownership.</p>



<p>The second problem was the price. However, this problem was resolved quite easily, as the bank, along with confirming ownership, also conducted a preliminary valuation of the goods and noted it in the certificate. Therefore, our team already had a starting price. This is the initial price that our team put into the smart contract responsible for the issuance of tokens for the luxury goods. Further price feed was based purely on on-chain info and auction mechanisms implemented in smart contracts. Thus, in this case, the initial price provided by the legal evaluation entity was enough to launch the automated evaluation mechanism.</p>



<p>Next, the process was quite standard &#8211; the number of tokens (which made sense as shares of ownership) was determined by the asset owner. Having the price, the number of tokens, and proof of ownership, the subsequent mechanism of public offering was a piece of cake for our smart contract engineering team.</p>



<p>Platform rules were simple:</p>



<ul><li>auction mechanics for asset price reevaluation;</li><li>ERC20 tokens issued for the RWA and distributed via the public offering based on the initial price;</li><li>the owner of the majority of tokens may initiate the process of the redemption of the RWA based on the price agreed among all token holders.</li></ul>



<p>However, such simple rules were possible after the careful platform design process and solving the initial problems from the legal side.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Future Trajectories</h2>



<p>The trajectory of asset tokenization is poised to reshape the landscape of investment and asset management.</p>
