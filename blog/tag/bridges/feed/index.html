										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite the great potential of blockchain, the technology faces a fundamental challenge: solitary ecosystems. Each blockchain operates in isolation, bound by its unique protocols, consensus mechanisms, and governance models, thus impeding seamless interaction. This fragmentation hinders the fluid exchange of information and value across different blockchain networks, presenting a significant barrier to the technology&#8217;s vision of creating a decentralized, interconnected digital world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-scaled.webp" alt="Cross-chain interoperability serves as the bridge, enabling diverse blockchain networks to overcome their inherent isolation and participate in a more integrated, expansive digital economy." class="wp-image-58896" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-scaled.webp 2560w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_10-1568x882.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p><strong>The question of why two blockchains cannot inherently interact with each other stems from their foundational design</strong>. Blockchains are built as independent ledgers, each with its distinct governance rules, security protocols, and data structures. This autonomy ensures security and integrity within each network but also creates an environment where interoperability is not natively built-in. Traditional financial systems, in contrast, have developed standardized protocols over decades that facilitate interbank communication.</p>



<p>In the blockchain world, however, the absence of a universal standard for cross-chain communication necessitates the development of interoperability solutions. Cross-chain interoperability thus serves as the bridge, enabling diverse blockchain networks to overcome their inherent isolation and participate in a more integrated, expansive digital economy.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-fce48b7b52ce113815500ca00a66cd6a">For a deeper understanding of how blockchain networks can be connected, explore <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/blockchain-bridging-explained/">Blaize comprehensive article on blockchain bridges</a>.</p>



<p>Cross-chain interoperability, then, becomes the critical solution. It represents the technological capability that enables disparate blockchain networks to communicate, share resources, and transfer value. This breakthrough overcomes the inherent limitations posed by isolated blockchains and amplifies the utility, efficiency, and scalability of blockchain applications. By bridging these divides, cross-chain interoperability fosters an ecosystem where information and assets flow freely, unlocking new opportunities for collaboration and innovation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is Cross-Chain Interoperability so Important?</h2>



<p>Cross-chain interoperability is not just a technical achievement but a vital component for the future scalability, versatility, and adoption of blockchain technologies. This interconnectedness allows for the creation of sophisticated, decentralized applications that can leverage the unique strengths of multiple blockchain platforms, thereby enhancing user experience, efficiency, and utility.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="1525" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-scaled.webp" alt="Cross-chain interoperability is an essential component for the future scalability, versatility, and adoption of blockchain technologies." class="wp-image-58895" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-scaled.webp 2560w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-1536x915.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-2048x1220.webp 2048w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_4-2-1568x934.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>The significance of cross-chain interoperability extends beyond mere asset transfer. It is foundational for achieving a truly decentralized and collaborative digital ecosystem. By enabling blockchains to interact without intermediaries, it fosters an environment where innovation can flourish, unhampered by the technological and philosophical divides that currently segment the blockchain space. This cross-communication capability ensures that blockchain technology can move towards a future where financial systems, supply chains, and digital identities are interconnected, providing a level of interoperability that matches, or even surpasses, that of current centralized systems.</p>



<p>Moreover, interoperability addresses one of the blockchain industry&#8217;s pressing challenges: network silos. It does so by enabling a fluid exchange of value and data across different blockchain networks, which, in turn, can lead to an increase in liquidity, improved security protocols through shared intelligence, and the creation of new markets and business models that were previously inconceivable. Projects and platforms that embrace cross-chain technology are at the forefront, driving the industry towards a more integrated, efficient, and user-centric future.</p>



<p>This is the vision that cross-chain interoperability promises, and its importance lies in several key areas:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Benefit:</strong></td><td><strong>Description:</strong></td><td><strong>Example:</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Enhanced DeFi Experience</strong></td><td>Currently, DeFi applications are largely restricted to the blockchain they&#8217;re built on. Cross-chain interoperability allows users to access a wider range of DeFi protocols and services, regardless of the underlying blockchain. Imagine seamlessly transferring your funds from a high-yield savings protocol on Ethereum to a lending platform on Solana for better interest rates.</td><td>Cross-chain interoperability protocols (CCIPs) like CCIP crypto: CCIP Explorer facilitate secure cross-chain communication, enabling innovative DeFi applications that leverage the strengths of multiple blockchains.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Increased Liquidity</strong></td><td>Fragmented liquidity across different blockchains hinders overall market efficiency.

Cross-chain interoperability removes these barriers, creating a more seamless and user-friendly experience.</td><td>Cross-chain messaging protocols like Axelar Network allow developers to build applications that can interact with assets and data on different blockchains without requiring users to manage complex infrastructure.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are Blockchain Interoperability Solutions?</h2>



<p>Imagine a world where different blockchains, each with their own strengths and functionalities, could seamlessly exchange information and assets. This interconnected future is what cross-chain interoperability promises to deliver. But how exactly do we achieve this communication between isolated blockchains? Let&#8217;s delve into the various solutions that are breaking down these barriers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="http://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/blockchain-bridging-explained/(opens in a new tab)">Cross-Chain Bridges</a></strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-scaled.webp" alt="Cross-chain bridges act as intermediaries between blockchains, facilitating the secure transfer of assets and data." class="wp-image-58893" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-scaled.webp 2560w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pic_3-2-1568x882.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>Cross-chain bridges act as intermediaries between blockchains, facilitating the secure transfer of assets and data. These bridges typically lock assets on the originating chain and mint an equivalent representation on the destination chain. When the user wants to return the asset, the bridge burns the representation on the destination chain and unlocks the original asset on the originating chain.</p>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Wormhole: Wormhole is a generic cross-chain bridge protocol that facilitates asset transfers between various blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche.</li>



<li>Multichain (formerly AnySwap): Multichain is a popular cross-chain bridge solution supporting a wide range of blockchains, known for its user-friendly interface and fast transaction times.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-f023c285532941a5ce14977beeb8d08f"><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-launch-a-project-on-polkadot-dapp-parachain-and-bridge/">Read Also: Blaize comprehensive guide on how to launch a dApp, bridge and parachain on Polkadot</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shared Validators</strong></h3>



<p>Shared validator protocols leverage a set of validators who participate in securing both blockchains. These validators are responsible for verifying transactions on both chains, creating a trustless environment for communication and data exchange.</p>



<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>More efficient than traditional bridges: Shared validator protocols can be more efficient than traditional cross-chain bridges as they don&#8217;t require locking assets.</li>



<li>Potentially lower fees: Transactions involving shared validator protocols may incur lower fees compared to bridge transactions.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Requires coordination between blockchains: Implementing shared validator protocols requires a high degree of coordination between the participating blockchains.</li>



<li>May not be suitable for all types of communication: Shared validator protocols might not be ideal for all types of cross-chain communication, particularly for complex data transfers.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Cosmos Hub: connects several subchains via Cosmos IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication). IBC can leverage shared validator sets between Cosmos-based blockchains to facilitate secure and efficient communication.</li>



<li>Polkadot parachains: Polkadot utilizes a shared security model where validators securing the main relay chain (Polkadot) can also participate in securing parachains (application-specific blockchains) connected to the relay chain.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Light Clients &amp; Oracles</strong></h3>



<p>Light client protocols and oracles form a powerful duo for achieving blockchain interoperability. These light clients reside on another blockchain and can efficiently communicate with the main chain. Think of oracles as information bridges. They act as trusted intermediaries, retrieving data from the source blockchain (where the light client resides) and relaying it to the target blockchain. This allows the target blockchain to verify the information without needing to download the entire history of the source chain.</p>



<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Efficient and Scalable: Light clients are compact and require minimal resources, making them ideal for frequent data transfers. This scalability is particularly beneficial for applications requiring real-time data feeds from multiple blockchains.</li>



<li>No Locked Assets: Unlike bridge solutions, light clients don&#8217;t require users to lock up their assets on a separate platform. This eliminates the risk of centralization associated with bridges.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Relies on the Trust of Oracles: The security of the entire system hinges on the reliability of oracles. Malicious or compromised oracles could potentially feed false information into the network.</li>



<li>Potential Data Manipulation Risks: Since oracles act as intermediaries, there&#8217;s a possibility of data manipulation if they&#8217;re not carefully designed and implemented.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Chainlink: A prominent decentralized oracle network (DON) that provides secure and reliable data feeds for various blockchain applications.</li>



<li>Pyth Network: A decentralized oracle network that provides a wide array of data types on-chain through Pyth Oracles, featuring advanced verification mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/a-comprehensive-guide-on-blockchain-layer-2-scaling-solutions/">Layer 2 Scaling Solutions</a></strong></h3>



<p>Layer 2 scaling solutions operate on top of a main chain, inheriting security from the main chain while enabling faster transactions. Some Layer 2 solutions, like rollups and Validium, are incorporating interoperability features to allow communication and asset transfer between the Layer 2 network and the main chain, or even other Layer 2 solutions.</p>



<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Faster transactions compared to main chain: Layer 2 solutions offer significantly faster and cheaper transactions compared to the main chain.</li>



<li>Potential for interoperability with other Layer 2 solutions: Interoperable Layer 2 solutions can create a more interconnected ecosystem with seamless asset and data flow.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the ever-evolving world of blockchain technology, the concept of <em>blockchain bridges</em> has emerged as a critical solution for creating and enhancing cross-chain interoperability across diverse networks. Blockchain bridges emerge as a perfect solution to the fragmentation dilemma. These protocols operate as secure, trust-minimized conduits, traversing the chasms between isolated networks and enabling the frictionless exchange of assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To better understand the essence of blockchain bridges, imagine:</p>



<p><strong><em>Problem</em>:</strong> A gaming company A on the Ethereum network, and company B, operating on BNB Chain, have users who want to trade digital assets between these two distinct blockchains. However, direct asset exchange is only possible due to compatible protocols.</p>



<p><strong><em>Solution</em>:</strong> A blockchain bridge is introduced, connecting Ethereum and BNB Chain. It allows Company A players to securely trade their Ethereum-based assets with Company B users on the BNB Chain. Assets are &#8216;locked&#8217; in a smart contract on one blockchain and an equivalent asset is &#8216;minted&#8217; on the other, facilitating seamless cross-chain asset trading.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="626" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_2-_3_.webp" alt="The concept of blockchain bridges has emerged as a critical solution for creating and enhancing cross-chain interoperability across diverse networks" class="wp-image-53704" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_2-_3_.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_2-_3_-1536x601.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_2-_3_-1568x613.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<p>In the absence of bridges, crypto assets remain tethered to their native networks, unable to participate in other ecosystems being ‘isolated’. This fragmentation stifles liquidity, impedes DeFi adoption, and ultimately limits the scope of crypto&#8217;s revolutionary potential.</p>



<p class="has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-1903d97ba7de4d91972acc609308abe3">With over 25 blockchains in our comprehensive expertise and countless bridge cases, we&#8217;ve accumulated real-world experience and insights. In this article, we&#8217;ll not only explain the technical intricacies of bridges but also share our practical experience in the domain. So let&#8217;s dive in!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Are Blockchain Bridges</h2>



<p>Blockchain bridges are protocols that facilitate the transfer of assets and data between different blockchains. They act as intermediaries, navigating the technical and security complexities of disparate networks to enable the frictionless flow of value. This cross-chain interoperability unlocks a wealth of benefits, transforming the fragmented crypto landscape into an interconnected system.</p>



<p>Blockchain bridges act as the architects of interoperability, seamlessly connecting previously isolated blockchain ecosystems. They enable the transfer of assets beyond simple swaps, empowering you to unlock opportunities that transcend individual networks.</p>



<p>Imagine holding ETH but discovering a lucrative DeFi yield farming opportunity on the Polygon network. Traditionally, you&#8217;d be forced to sell your ETH, incur conversion fees, and potentially miss out on fleeting market movements.</p>



<p>Bridges offer a more strategic solution. You can deposit your ETH into the bridge, which securely locks it and mints an equivalent amount of &#8220;wrapped&#8221; WETH on the Polygon network. This WETH functions identically to native ETH within the Polygon ecosystem, allowing you to participate in the desired yield farm without sacrificing your original position.</p>



<p>This scenario exemplifies the true power of bridges: unlocking diverse use cases beyond straightforward asset swaps. Whether you seek better DeFi rates, explore innovative dApps, or capitalize on arbitrage opportunities, bridges empower you to leverage the full potential of your assets across a multitude of chains.</p>



<p>Remember, while bridges offer distinct advantages, they may involve slightly higher fees compared to centralized exchanges. Additionally, their value shines brightest when seeking opportunities for the same asset across different networks. By choosing the right bridge and understanding its specific fees and functionalities, you can effectively navigate the interoperable landscape and maximize your blockchain experience.</p>



<p>This is just one example of the transformative power of blockchain bridges. Their impact extends far beyond individual user convenience, fostering a more efficient digital economy:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DeFi Growth</strong>: Bridges empower users to access and optimize DeFi protocols across multiple networks, maximizing yield opportunities and diversifying risk.</li>



<li><strong>Liquidity Liberation</strong>: Trapped assets gain freedom, injecting crucial liquidity into decentralized exchanges and fostering efficient price discovery across diverse token ecosystems.</li>



<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Unfettered asset flow fuels the development of next-generation cross-chain applications and protocols, leading to unprecedented levels of collaboration and innovation within the cryptosphere.</li>
</ul>



<p>Blaize has prepared a comprehensive guide on <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/cross-chain-interoperability/">cross-chain interoperability</a>, explaining its pros and cons and considering several real-life examples. The article is already available under the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/cross-chain-interoperability/">link</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Do Blockchain Bridges Work</h2>



<p>Blockchain bridges employ advanced mechanisms to ensure secure and efficient cross-chain interactions. These methods vary but primarily include the <strong>Wrapped Asset Method</strong> and the <strong>Liquidity Pool Method</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="638" src="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_3-_6_-копія.webp" alt="Blockchain bridges employ advanced mechanisms to ensure secure and efficient cross-chain interactions." class="wp-image-53705" srcset="https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_3-_6_-копія.webp 1600w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_3-_6_-копія-1536x612.webp 1536w, https://blaize.tech/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pic_3-_6_-копія-1568x625.webp 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wrapped Asset Method</strong></h3>



<p>This approach involves &#8216;wrapping&#8217; an asset from one blockchain into a token on another blockchain. This wrapped token represents the same value and can be unwrapped back into the original asset, ensuring asset portability across blockchains.</p>



<p>The wrapped asset method adopts a custodian-like approach, safeguarding your original asset while facilitating its interaction on the target chain.</p>



<ul>
<li>Escrow of Origin: When you initiate a bridge transaction, your native asset gets deposited into a dedicated smart contract on the source chain. This smart contract acts as a secure vault, locking your asset out of circulation and guaranteeing its return upon redemption.</li>



<li>Mirror Image Minting: Concurrently, on the target chain, an equivalent amount of &#8220;wrapped&#8221; tokens is minted. These tokens, pegged 1:1 to your original asset, function seamlessly within the target network, granting you access to its DeFi protocols, exchanges, and dApps.</li>



<li>Unwrapping the Value: To return home, you submit a redemption request on the target chain. Upon verification, the corresponding wrapped tokens are burned, and the smart contract on the source chain releases your original asset, completing the safe passage back to its native realm.</li>
</ul>



<p>While prioritizing security with its escrowed custodianship, this method introduces a degree of centralization. The smart contract holding your assets becomes a potential vulnerability, and its design and operational security become paramount considerations</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquidity Pool Method</strong></h3>



<p>In this method, liquidity pools are used to facilitate asset transfers. Users deposit assets into a pool on one blockchain and receive an equivalent value on another blockchain. This ensures liquidity and seamless transfers across different networks. Instead of individual copies, the liquidity pool method envisions a constantly flowing river of cross-chain value.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Contributing to the Flow: </strong>To initiate a bridge crossing, you deposit your native asset into a liquidity pool on the source chain. This pool, governed by smart contracts, dynamically manages the total value locked on both sides of the bridge, ensuring a balanced ratio of native and wrapped tokens.</li>



<li><strong>Swapping with Precision:</strong> By exchanging your tokens within the pool, you trigger the automatic minting or burning of wrapped tokens on the other side, effectively swapping your asset&#8217;s native form for its cross-chain doppelganger. Smart contracts ensure precise exchange rates and maintain sufficient liquidity in both pools.</li>



<li><strong>Maintaining Equilibrium: </strong>To guarantee the bridge&#8217;s smooth operation, advanced algorithms constantly adjust the pool sizes on both sides, balancing supply and demand. This dynamic equilibrium incentivizes user participation and rewards liquidity providers for contributing to the bridge&#8217;s functionality.</li>
</ul>



<p>While offering a more decentralized approach, the liquidity pool method introduces considerations like potential price slippage (temporary deviations from desired exchange rates) and impermanent loss (risks faced by liquidity providers due to changing pool ratios).</p>



<p>By understanding these intricate mechanisms, we gain a deeper appreciation for the technological prowess of blockchain bridges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of Blockchain Bridges</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a Blockchain Bridge?</strong></h3>



<p>A blockchain bridge is an essential technology in the world of digital assets, serving as a connection between different blockchain networks. It allows for the transfer and sharing of information, assets, and smart contracts across various blockchain ecosystems. This enables isolated blockchains to communicate with each other, thereby overcoming their inherent limitations and enhancing the interoperability of the blockchain space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Does a Blockchain Bridge Work?</strong></h3>



<p>A blockchain bridge operates by either using a Wrapped Asset Method or a Liquidity Pool Method. The Wrapped Asset Method involves representing an asset from one blockchain as a token on another blockchain, maintaining its original value. This token can then be transferred across the bridge and &#8216;unwrapped&#8217; back into the original asset. The Liquidity Pool Method, on the other hand, uses pools of assets where users deposit their assets on one blockchain and receive an equivalent value on another. This method ensures liquidity and facilitates the smooth transfer of assets across different networks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are Blockchain Bridges Secure?</strong></h3>



<p>The security of blockchain bridges varies based on their design and implementation. While trustless bridges offer increased security through decentralized control, reducing the reliance on a single entity, they are not completely risk-free. Trusted bridges, controlled by centralized parties, provide a different security model with their own set of risks and benefits. Ensuring security in blockchain bridges involves auditing, continuous monitoring, and the implementation of security protocols to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Use a Blockchain Bridge Instead of a Centralized Exchange?</strong></h3>



<p>Using a blockchain bridge instead of a centralized exchange offers several advantages. Bridges enable direct, peer-to-peer transactions between different blockchains, reducing reliance on central intermediaries. This enhances the autonomy and privacy of users. They also support a wider range of tokens and assets.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Are Some Popular Blockchain Bridges?</strong></h3>



<p>Several popular blockchain bridges have gained prominence in the crypto community, each offering unique features and capabilities. These include bridges like Stargate, Across, and Celer cBridge. These multi-chain platforms enable the transfer of assets like cryptocurrency and tokens between major blockchains.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While the whole community is keenly looking forward to the next phase of the Polkadot mainnet launch, Blaize’s team of blockchain architects want to share some knowledge using Polkadot Substrate for building parachains.</p>



<p>We have reviewed some of the <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most promising Polkadot startups</a> in one of our previous articles. In this blog post, we would like to explain how to launch a project on Polkadot, develop a dApp similar to these examples, or implement a parachain. We will also describe how to make a cross-chain bridge between Polkadot and other existing solutions. And if you are interested in <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/decentralized-application/">dApp development services</a></strong>, please contact us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Do You Need to Develop a dApp on Polkadot?</strong></h2>



<p>Polkadot is a fast-growing ecosystem that will enable cross-chain communication within its parachains. Such interoperability and scale will bring blockchain technology to the next level and solve a number of problems (e.g. low TPS, high transaction fees, hard forks, etc.).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum DeFi is one of the biggest markets for dApp development. The growing number of Polkadot dApps heightens the problem of Ethereum chain operability as well as transaction costs. Polkadot&#8217;s scalable and interoperable environment makes it very attractive in terms of Ethereum DeFi’s future migration to Polkadot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read Also: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/which-blockchain-to-fork-to-start-your-own-cryptocurrency/">How to fork a cryptocurrency</a></strong></p>



<p>The claim has already proven its relevance through the successful implementation of new solutions like RIO Chain. It is built as a Polkadot parachain that provides ready-made tools to <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-build-a-successful-defi-project/">develop DeFi dApp</a> on Polkadot. As an alternative, you can build Polkadot dApp on Substrate-based chains or deploy smart contracts to Moonbeam or Edgeware. </p>

<p><em>We will explain how to develop and launch your dApp project on Polkadot in the following sections of this article.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Initial integration with Polkadot&nbsp;</h2>



<p>From our experience, <strong><em>we can define the following types of possible launch on Polkadot:</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#BUILDING-A-PARACHAIN-TO-POLKADOT">Building a parachain for Polkadot</a></strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="#DEVELOP-A-DAPP-ON-POLKADOT">Building dApp on Substrate-based blockchain</a></strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="#CREATE-A-CROSS-CHAIN-BRIDGE-TO-THE-POLKADOT-ECOSYSTEM">Creating a cross-chain bridge</a></strong> (from your current solution to one of Polkadot’s parachains)</li>
</ol>



<p>Those are generalized examples combining a long list of possibilities into three main groups. We would like to share more technical aspects regarding each type next.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Blaize’s team of blockchain developers has been studying the unique technical specifications of the Polkadot ecosystem for a few years. We are currently working on several projects to launch on the network in the near future. <a href="https://twitter.com/blaize_tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Follow Blaize</a> news updates to see future case description in detail.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="BUILDING-A-PARACHAIN-TO-POLKADOT">Building a parachain to Polkadot</h2>



<p>Before considering this approach and starting parachain development, <strong><em>let’s define what a parachain is</em></strong> and why it is different from running an independent blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polkadot provides a highly scalable and secure ecosystem of blockchains. Yet, those blockchains are actually parachains. The main difference between them lies in <strong>shared security</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any created parachain has to be connected to the Relay Chain (the main chain of Polkadot). Along with this connection, the Relay chain will provide the parachain security and a guarantee of secure cross-chain communication (<a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-transport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCMP</a>) between all connected parachains in the system. <em>Thus, the Polkadot ecosystem ensures the desired interoperability and scalability of all chains together.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Polkadot Parachain Development</strong></h2>



<p>There is a claim that creating a Polkadot parachain requires a strong knowledge of Substrate. Substrate as well as Polkadot are written in the Rust language. Consequently, you can implement parachain development in Rust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From another perspective, generally, you can implement a custom blockchain development in any language (C++, Go or Java). If a certain interface is respected you can connect it as a parachain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, in order to ease development, Polkadot provides PDKs (which stands for Parachain Development Kit). Currently, there are two functioning PDKs which are <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Substrate</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cumulus</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parity Substrate is a cutting-edge solution that allows for building a complex blockchain architecture within a short period of time. This reduces Polkadot development time significantly from years to weeks. So we recommend using the ready-made Substrate framework for building a parachain instead of writing initial <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/5-best-programming-languages-for-blockchain-development/">coding</a> in Rust, Go, or others.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background"><em>Previous working experience with Substrate will be a huge plus. Get to know more about the Substrate framework and its characteristics in <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/best-platforms-for-blockchain-development/#PARITY-SUBSTRATE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Blockchain Platforms comparison</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>The basic set of tools for Polkadot parachain development:</em></strong></h4>



<ul>
<li>Substrate 2.0.0.</li>



<li>Polkadot source code&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WASM interpreter</a> and compiler to WASM</li>



<li>Rococo&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The first step is to set up the latest version of the Substrate framework. The best way is to use Parity Knowledge Base. As soon as the environment is prepared, we can start to modify the live version of the parachain template code. The initial code can be taken from the Polkadot repository <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/roadmap/implementers-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/6d8df098600232750cc677f9d8617649.js"></script>



<p>Substrate technology contains all the necessary modules and frames for an independent chain development. But it does not have the required compatibility feature with Polkadot.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Therefore, as soon as the main chain architecture is done, you need to start using the </strong><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cumulus</a><strong> library. </strong>Cumulus will add the required parachain code while importing a Substrate-based chain to the library. Thus, it makes it compatible with the Polkadot environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to check a new-build parachain, we need a testnet examination. One of the major Polkadot testnets, <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://rococo-rpc.polkadot.io#/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rococo</a>, has been created to meet the specifications of <em>parachains testing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After testing you will need a parachain slot to deploy your chain and connect to the Relay chain. The project will need to acquire one of the parachains’ slots in the auction that will take place shortly. But take into account, you can test and deploy your parachain on <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/#KUSAMA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kusama</a> (Polkadot cousin). </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="DEVELOP-A-DAPP-ON-POLKADOT">Develop a dApp on Polkadot&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Claiming a breakthrough in operability and scalability Polkadot attracts a lot of minds eager to build dApps on Polkadot within its network. It is especially attractive for open finance developers seeking to create a full market of DeFi on Polkadot (read about <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/top-notch-defi-derivatives-you-should-know-about/"><strong>DeFi derivatives</strong></a>).</p>



<p>The first thing you should know is that the Polkadot Relay chain itself does not support any Polkadot smart contract framework. However, the arbitrary state transitions inserted into parachains do offer such support. This technology will be released shortly and will allow for building dApps on a Polkadot parachain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read Also: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/overview/amm-solutions-to-impermanent-loss-and-front-running/">How to Avoid Impermanent Loss and Front-running Problem in DeFi</a></strong>.</p>



<p>For now, it is recommended to use one of the existing technologies and prepare your future Polkadot dApp to be ready when the parachain starts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Smart contracts are a core for any decentralized application development. The Polkadot system is very complex and tiered, but there are a few ways to deploy smart contracts on Polkadot:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Develop smart contracts in any language compiled to WASM (Java, Go, etc.)</li>



<li>Develop dApp using Substrate EVM pallet&nbsp;</li>



<li>Develop dApp using Substrate <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/ink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ink</a> contracts pallet&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>We will use the third approach to provide an example of dApp development for smooth integration with a Polkadot parachain in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Example of dApp development on Substrate-based chain&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Due to wider adoption of Substrate and its growing demand, we would like to show the example of using Substrate FRAME for building a dApp for Polkadot.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>The basic set of tools for (Polkadot) dApp development:</em></strong></h4>



<ul>
<li>Substrate 2.0.0.</li>



<li>Rust</li>



<li>!Ink</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/wasmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WASM interpreter</a> and compiler to WASM</li>
</ul>



<p>Substrate FRAME is a code library storing ready-made modules (or otherwise pallets) to build your custom blockchain with Substrate. To create a decentralized app on top of it, one needs to combine chosen modules into the “runtime” of the framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to enable smart contract functionality we should add a <em>_contracts </em>pallet. </p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/420c26142b5e94a895a50f0341716896.js"></script>



<p>For customization, we can add all necessary imports and dependencies, develop on Polkadot custom traits within this pallet or even add more custom pallets and start the configuration.</p>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/26eafdb3bc3ffcfcaa0b2b66dc655df0.js"></script>



<p>After that, you can think of deploying Polkadot smart contracts for your dApp to the live environment. Currently, there are two leading solutions that offer smart contracts running via the Polkadot environment: Moonbeam and Edgeware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Edgeware is a Substrate-based chain that will connect to the Relay Chain as one of the Polkadot parachains in the near future. It enables smart contracts on Polkadot to run with its further compilation to WASM. Edgeware is a perfect solution to try out the contracts made with the contracts’ pallet from the Substrate FRAME library.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In case you have chosen the Substrate EVM pallet, think of a Moonbeam smart contract solution. It uses an interoperable layer containing the current Ethereum toolset called <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier</a>. The Moonbeam platform will support all application contracts written for the EVM environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em><span class="has-inline-color has-primary-red-color">Read more detailed information about Moonbeam and Edgeware projects in <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/top-startups-on-polkadot-that-will-rock-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Projects on Polkadot</a>.&nbsp;</span></em></strong></h4>



<p>To underline, <strong>you can deploy smart contracts on Polkadot only using one of its parachains.</strong> Though you can build your custom dApp on your own Substrate-based node.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, consider trying any of the smart contract solutions for Polkadot detailed above.&nbsp;Read: <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/ethereum-based-dapp-development-for-trading-platform/">Ethereum dApp Development Guide</a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="CREATE-A-CROSS-CHAIN-BRIDGE-TO-THE-POLKADOT-ECOSYSTEM">Create a cross-chain bridge to the Polkadot ecosystem</h2>



<p>Building a cross-chain bridge is the other way to connect to the Polkadot ecosystem. There are basically two options: create a bridge for your current solution, or provide bridge-as-a-service between two existing decentralized protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a technical point of view, a cross-chain bridge is an app for a token “transfer” between two blockchains. The transfer is made through smart contracts on both sides of the bridge and a decentralized network of independent validators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>The cross-chain bridge idea implies that tokens are moving (or transferring) between chains or protocols. But in fact, when a money transfer request occurs, the contract burns tokens on one chain and mints them on the other.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p class="has-white-color has-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background">There is a feature when the contract locks tokens instead of burning them if the initial token contract does not provide a <em>burning function. </em>Those specifications might be hard to detect for a less experienced blockchain developer. Read <a href="https://blaize.tech/article-type/how-to-choose-a-reliable-blockchain-company-for-your-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to find experienced blockchain developers</a> to create a solid project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to make any transaction, the contract needs a signature from a subset of validators that run the bridge. That is why the bridge is quite similar to the way a multisig contract functions. When a money transfer request goes to one of the contracts, the relayers (validators) ought to create a vote on this transaction and approve token minting on the opposite side of the bridge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Substrate framework provides a full collection of components and pallets for building bridges. The full documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/parity-bridges-common" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example, we will build a relay bridge from Ethereum to Polkadot. We decided to use !Ink because it is the primary language for smart contracts on Substrate. As an alternative, we may use Rust with no inconvenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-primary-red-color"><em>Relay bridge components:&nbsp;</em></span></strong></p>



<p><strong>01 Smart contracts&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>As we have mentioned before, we should create smart contracts on both sides of the bridge.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>02 Substrate pallets</strong></p>



<p>For cross-chain bridge implementation, we can use the following Substrate pallets: <em>syncing header</em> pallet, <em>arbitrary messages</em> pallet,<em> relayer</em> pallet.</p>



<p><strong>03 Validator program&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>One of the most important parts of this development is the validator program. This should take into account such parameters as the number of validators (relayers) and the established threshold for them. The threshold is the limit of required validators to approve the transaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in case there are five relayers for this bridge, and the threshold amount is three, the transaction will be approved after three confirmations occur with no need to wait for the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The daily limit is another substantial element of the validator’s program development. By establishing this feature you can specify the exact amount of funds that can be passed to one side per day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The example of validation method for approving cross-chain transactions:</p>

<p><strong>04 Application interface (UI)</strong></p>



<p>To interact with both sides of the bridge and the smart contracts in it, you will need a dApp. That is how the end-user will benefit from the bridge and <em>“transfer”</em> funds from one chain to another.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center has-white-color has-primary-red-background-color has-text-color has-background"><strong><em>Thinking of creating a bridge? <a href="#post_contact">Contact Blaize</a> experts to schedule a meeting to start development ASAP!</em></strong></p>



<p>Existing Ethereum-based DeFi protocols should consider creating a cross-chain bridge to Polkadot. This type of development is faster than making a new dApp and has significant potential for possible interactions. You can create a bridge from the current solution to a Polkadot parachain as well as connect to existing Moonbeam contracts. Such projects as Akropolis, <a href="https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/private/adash47d-chainbridge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainsafe</a>, and <a href="https://snowfork.substack.com/p/a-trustless-general-purpose-polkadot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snowfork</a> have already presented similar cross-chain solutions. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In this article, we have shown how to build a parachain on Polkadot or use a Substrate-based chain to create a dApp. We have also reviewed the process of creating a cross-chain bridge between Ethereum and Polkadot and answered the questions of why and when it is applicable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Polkadot is a fast-growing ecosystem that has a great impact on the blockchain community. After reading this post, you now know how you can join it and build your own dApp or parachain for Polkadot.&nbsp;We also invite you to familiarize yourself with our expertise in the <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/nft-development-services/">development of NFT tokens</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://blaize.tech/gamefi-development-company/">GameFi development</a></strong>.</p>
